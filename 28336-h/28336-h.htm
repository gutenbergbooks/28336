  <h3>No. I.</h3>

  <p>Alexander the Great said, when he approached the tomb of Achilles,
  &quot;Oh! fortunate youth, who had a Homer to be the herald of your
  fame!&quot; &quot;And well did he say so,&quot; says the Roman
  historian: &quot;for, unless the <i>Iliad</i> had been written, the
  same earth which covered his body would have buried his name.&quot;
  Never was the truth of these words more clearly evinced than in the
  case of the Duke of <span class='smcap'>Marlborough</span>.
  Consummate as were the abilities, unbroken the success, immense the
  services of this great commander, he can scarcely be said to be known
  to the vast majority of his countrymen. They have heard the distant
  echo of his fame as they have that of the exploits of Timour, of
  Bajazet, and of Genghis Khan; the names of Blenheim and Ramillies, of
  Malplaquet and Oudenarde, awaken a transient feeling of exultation in
  their bosoms; but as to the particulars of these events, the
  difficulties with which their general had to struggle, the objects
  for which he contended, even the places where they occurred, they
  are, for the most part, as ignorant as they are of similar details in
  the campaigns of Baber or Aurengzebe. What they do know, is derived
  chiefly, if not entirely, from the histories of their enemies.
  Marlborough&#39;s exploits have made a prodigious impression on the
  Continent. The French, who felt the edge of his flaming sword, and
  saw the glories of the <i>Grande Monarque</i> torn from the long
  triumphant brow of Louis XIV.; the Dutch, who found in his conquering
  arm the stay of their sinking republic, and their salvation from
  slavery and persecution; the Germans, who saw the flames of the
  Palatinate avenged by his resistless power, and the ravages of war
  rolled back from the Rhine into the territory of the state which had
  provoked them; the Lutherans, who beheld in him the appointed
  instrument of divine vengeance, to punish the abominable perfidy and
  cruelty of the revocation of the edict of Nantes&#8212;have concurred
  in celebrating his exploits. The French nurses frightened their
  children with stories of &quot;Marlbrook,&quot; as the Orientals say,
  when their horses start, they see the shadow of Richard
  C&#339;ur-de-Lion crossing their path. Napoleon hummed the well-known
  air, &quot;Marlbrook s&#39;en va Ã  la guerre,&quot; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> when he
  crossed the Niemen to commence the Moscow campaign. But in England,
  the country which he has made illustrious, the nation he has saved,
  the land of his birth, he is comparatively forgotten; and were it not
  for the popular pages of Voltaire, and the shadow which a great name
  throws over the stream of time in spite of every neglect, he would
  bevirtually unknown at this moment to nineteen-twentieths of the
  British people.</p>

  <p>It is the fault of the national historians which has occasioned
  this singular injustice to one of the greatest of British
  heroes&#8212;certainly the most consummate, if we except Wellington,
  of British military commanders. No man has yet appeared who has done
  any thing like justice to the exploits of Marlborough. Smollett,
  whose unpretending narrative, compiled for the bookseller, has
  obtained a passing popularity by being the only existing sequel to
  Hume, had none of the qualities necessary to write a military
  history, or make the narrative of heroic exploits interesting. His
  talents for humour, as all the world knows, were great&#8212;for
  private adventure, or the delineation of common life in novels,
  considerable. But he had none of the higher qualities necessary to
  form a great historian; he had neither dramatic nor descriptive
  power; he was entirely destitute of philosophic views or power of
  general argument. In the delineation of individual character, he is
  often happy; his talents as a novelist, and as the narrator of
  private events, there appear to advantage. But he was neither a poet
  nor a painter, a statesman nor a philosopher. He neither saw whence
  the stream of events had come, nor whither it was going. We look in
  vain in his pages for the lucid arguments and rhetorical power with
  which Hume illustrated, and brought, as it were, under the mind&#39;s
  eye, the general arguments urged, or rather which might be urged by
  ability equal to his own, for and against every great change in
  British history. As little do we find the captivating colours with
  which Robertson has painted the discovery and wonders of America, or
  the luminous glance which he has thrown over the progress of society
  in the first volume of Charles V. Gibbon&#39;s incomparable powers of
  classification and description are wholly awanting. The fire of
  Napier&#39;s military pictures need not be looked for. What is
  usually complained of in Smollett, especially by his young readers,
  is, that he is so dull&#8212;the most fatal of all defects, and the
  most inexcusable in an historian. His heart was not in history, his
  hand was not trained to it; it is in &quot;Roderick Random&quot; or
  &quot;Peregrine Pickle,&quot; not the continuation of Hume, that his
  powers are to be seen.</p>

  <p>Lord Mahon has brought to the subject of the history of England
  from the treaty of Utrecht to that of Aix-la-Chapelle, talents of a
  kind much better adapted for doing justice to Marlborough&#39;s
  campaigns. He has remarkable power for individual narrative. His
  account of the gallant attempt, and subsequent hair-breadth escapes
  of the Pretender in 1745, is full of interest, and is justly praised
  by Sismondi as by far the best account extant of that romantic
  adventure. He possesses also a fair and equitable judgment, much
  discrimination, evident talent for drawing characters, and that
  upright and honourable heart, which is the first requisite for
  success in the delineation, as it is for success in the conduct of
  events. His industry in examining and collecting authorities is
  great; he is a scholar, a statesman, and a gentleman&#8212;no small
  requisites for the just delineation of noble and generous
  achievements. But notwithstanding all this, his work is not the one
  to rescue Marlborough&#39;s fame from the unworthy obscurity into
  which, in this country, it has fallen. He takes up the thread of
  events where Marlborough left them: he begins only at the peace of
  Utrecht. Besides this, he is not by nature a military historian, and
  if he had begun at the Revolution, the case would probably have been
  the same. Lord Mahon&#39;s attention has been mainly fixed on
  domestic story; it is in illustrating parliamentary contests or court
  intrigues, not military events, that his powers have been put forth.
  He has given a clear, judicious, and elegant narrative of British
  history, as regards these, so far as it is embraced by his
  accomplished pen; but the historian of Marlborough must treat him
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
  as second to none, not even to Louis XIV. or William III. Justice
  will never be done to the hero of the English revolution, till his
  Life is the subject of a separate work in every schoolboy&#39;s
  hands. We must have a memoir of him to be the companion of
  Southey&#39;s Life of Nelson, and Napier&#39;s Peninsular War.</p>

  <p>Voltaire, in his &quot;SiÃ¨cle de Louis XIV.,&quot; could not avoid
  giving a sketch of the exploits of the British hero; and his natural
  impartiality has led him, so far as it goes, to give a tolerably fair
  one. It need hardly be said, that coming from the pen of such a
  writer, it is lively, animated, and distinct. But Voltaire was not a
  military historian; he had none of the feelings or associations which
  constitute one. War, when he wrote, had been for above half a
  century, with a few brilliant exceptions, a losing game to the
  French. In the War of the Succession they had lost their ascendancy
  in continental Europe; in that of the Seven Years, nearly their whole
  colonial dominions. The hard-won glories of Fontenoy, the doubtful
  success of Laffelt, were a poor compensation for these disasters. It
  was the fashion of his day to decry war as the game of kings, or
  flowing from the ambition of priests; if superstition was abolished,
  and popular virtue let into government, one eternal reign of peace
  and justice would commence. With these writers the great object was,
  to carry the cabinets of kings by assault, and introduce philosophers
  into government through the antechambers of mistresses. Peter the
  Great was their hero, Catharine of Russia their divinity, for they
  placed philosophers at the head of affairs. It was not to be supposed
  that in France, the vanquished country, in such an age justice should
  be done to the English conqueror. Yet such were the talents of
  Voltaire, especially for making a subject popular, that it is on his
  work, such as it is, that the fame of Marlborough mainly rests, even
  in his own country.</p>

  <p>Marlborough, as might be expected, has not wanted biographers who
  have devoted themselves, expressly and exclusively, to transmit his
  fame and deeds to posterity. They have for the most part failed, from
  the faults most fatal, and yet most common to biographers&#8212;undue
  partiality in some, dulness and want of genius in others. They began
  at an early period after his death, and are distinguished at first by
  that rancour on the one side, and exaggeration on the other, by which
  such contemporary narratives are generally, and in that age were in a
  peculiar manner, distinguished. I. An abridged account of his life,
  dedicated to the Duke of Montague, his son-in-law, appeared at
  Amsterdam in 12mo; but it is nothing but an anonymous panegyric. II.
  Not many years after, a life of Marlborough was published, in three
  volumes quarto, by Thomas Ledyard, who had accompanied him in many of
  his later travels, and had been the spectator of some of the last of
  his military exploits. This is a work of much higher authority, and
  contains much valuable information; but it is prolix, long-winded,
  and diffuse, filled with immaterial documents, and written throughout
  in a tone of inflated panegyric. III. Another life of Marlborough,
  written with more ability, appeared at Paris in 1806, in three
  volumes octavo, by Dutems. The author had the advantage of all the
  resources for throwing light on his history which the archives of
  France, then at the disposal of Napoleon, who had a high admiration
  for the English general, could afford; but it could hardly be
  expected that, till national historians of adequate capacity for the
  task had appeared, it was to be properly discharged by foreigners.
  Yet such is the partiality which an author naturally contracts for
  the hero of his biography, that the work of Dutems, though the author
  has shown himself by no means blind to his hero&#39;s faults, is
  perhaps chiefly blameable for being too much of a panegyric. IV. By
  far the fullest and most complete history of Marlborough, however, is
  that which was published at London in 1818, by Archdeacon Coxe, in
  five volumes octavo. This learned author had access to all the
  official documents on the subject then known to be in existence,
  particularly the Blenheim Papers, and he has made good use of the
  ample materials placed at his disposal; but it cannot be said that he
  has made an interesting, though he certainly has a valuable, work. It
  has reached a second <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id=
  "Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> edition, but it is now little heard of: a
  certain proof, if the importance of his subject, and value of his
  materials is taken into account, that it labours under some
  insurmountable defects in composition. Nor is it difficult to see
  what these defects are. The venerable Archdeacon, respectable for his
  industry, his learning, his researches, had not a ray of genius, and
  genius is the soul of history. He gives every thing with equal
  minuteness, makes no attempt at digesting or compression, and fills
  his pages with letters and state-papers at full length; the certain
  way, if not connected by ability, to send them to the bottom.</p>

  <p>Dean Swift&#39;s history of the four last years of Queen Anne, and
  his Apology for the same sovereign, contain much valuable information
  concerning Marlborough&#39;s life; but it is so mixed up with the
  gall and party spirit which formed so essential a part of the Dean of
  St Patrick&#39;s character, that it cannot be relied on as impartial
  or authentic.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The life of James II. by
  Clarke contains a great variety of valuable and curious details drawn
  from the Stuart Papers sent to the Prince Regent on the demise of the
  Cardinal York; and it would be well for the reputation of
  Marlborough, as well as many other eminent men of the seventeenth and
  eighteenth centuries, if some of them could be buried in oblivion.
  But by far the best life of Marlborough, in a military point of view,
  is that recently published by Mr Gleig, in his &quot;Military
  Commanders of Great Britain,&quot;&#8212;a sketch characterized by
  all the scientific knowledge, practical acquaintance with war, and
  brilliant power of description, by which the other writings of that
  gifted author are distinguished. If he would make as good use of the
  vast collection of papers which, under the able auspices of Sir
  George Murray, have now issued from the press, as he has of the more
  scanty materials at his disposal when he wrote his account of
  Marlborough, he would write <i>the</i> history of that hero, and
  supersede the wish even for any other.</p>

  <p>The fortunate accident is generally known by which the great
  collection of papers now in course of publication in London has been
  brought to light. That this collection should at length have become
  known is less surprising than that it should so long have remained
  forgotten, and have eluded the searches of so many persons interested
  in the subject. It embraces, as Sir George Murray&#39;s lucid preface
  mentions, a complete series of the correspondence of the great duke
  from 1702 to 1712, the ten years of his most important public
  services. In addition to the despatches of the duke himself, the
  letters, almost equally numerous, of his private secretary, M.
  Cardonnell, and a journal written by his grace&#39;s chaplain, Dr
  Hare, afterwards Bishop of Chichester, are contained in the eighteen
  manuscript volumes which were discovered in the record-room of
  Hensington, near Woodstock, in October 1842, and are now given to the
  public. They are of essential service, especially in rendering
  intelligible the details of the correspondence, which would otherwise
  in great part be uninteresting, and scarce understood, at least by
  the ordinary reader. Some of the most valuable parts of the work,
  particularly a full detail of the battle of Blenheim, are drawn from
  Dr Hare&#39;s journal. In addition to this, the bulletins of most of
  the events, issued by government at the time, are to be found in
  notes at the proper places; and in the text are occasionally
  contained short, but correct and luminous notices, of the preceding
  or contemporaneous political and military events which are alluded
  to, but not described, in the despatches, and which are necessary to
  understand many of their particulars. Nothing, in a word, has been
  omitted by the accomplished editor which could illustrate or render
  intelligible the valuable collection of materials placed at his
  disposal; and yet, with all his pains and ability, it is often very
  difficult to follow the detail of events, or understand the matter
  alluded to in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id=
  "Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> despatches:&#8212;so great is the lack of
  information on the eventful War of the Succession which prevails,
  from the want of a popular historian to record it, even among
  well-informed persons in this country; and so true was the
  observation of Alexander the Great, that but for the genius of Homer,
  the exploits of Achilles would have been buried under the tumulus
  which covered his remains! And what should we have known of Alexander
  himself more than of Attila or Genghis Khan, but for the fascinating
  pages of Quintus Curtius and Arrian?</p>

  <p>To the historian who is to go minutely into the details of
  Marlborough&#39;s campaigns and negotiations, and to whom accurate
  and authentic information is of inestimable importance, it need
  hardly be said that these papers are of the utmost value. But, to the
  general reader, all such voluminous publications and despatches must,
  as a matter of necessity, be comparatively uninteresting. They always
  contain a great deal of repetition, in consequence of the necessity
  under which the commander lay, of communicating the same event to
  those with whom he was in correspondence in many different quarters.
  Great part of them relate to details of discipline, furnishing
  supplies, getting up stores, and other necessary matters, of little
  value even to the historian, except in so far as they illustrate the
  industry, energy, and difficulties of the commander. The general
  reader who plunges into the midst of the Marlborough despatches in
  this age, or into those of Wellington in the next, when contemporary
  recollection is lost, will find it impossible to understand the
  greater part of the matters referred to, and will soon lay aside the
  volumes in despair. Such works are highly valuable, but they are so
  to the annalist or historian rather than the ordinary reader. They
  are the materials of history, not history itself. They bear the same
  relation to the works of Livy or Gibbon which the rude blocks in the
  quarry do to the temples of St Peter&#39;s or the Parthenon. Ordinary
  readers are not aware of this when they take up a volume of
  despatches; they expect to be as much fascinated by it as they are by
  the correspondence of Madame de SevignÃ©, Cowper, Gibbon, or Arnold.
  They will soon find their mistake: the book-sellers will erelong find
  it in the sale of such works. The matter-of-fact men in ordinary
  life, and the compilers and drudges in literature&#8212;that is,
  nine-tenths of the readers and writers in the world&#8212;are never
  weary of descanting on the inestimable importance of authentic
  documents for history; and without doubt they are right so far as the
  collecting of materials goes. There must be quarriers before there
  can be architects: the hewers of wood and drawers of water are the
  basis of all civilization. But they are not civilization itself, they
  are its pioneers. Truth is essential to an estimable character: but
  many a man is insupportably dull who never told a falsehood. The
  pioneers of Marlborough, however, have now gone before, and it will
  be the fault of English genius if the divine artist does not erelong
  make the proper use of the materials at length placed in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>John Churchill, afterwards Duke of Marlborough, was born on the
  5th July 1650, (new style,) at Ash, in the county of Devon. His
  father was Sir Winston Churchill, a gallant cavalier who had drawn
  his sword in behalf of Charles I., and had in consequence been
  deprived of his fortune and driven into exile by Cromwell. His
  paternal family was very ancient, and boasted its descent from the
  <i>Courcils</i> de Poitou, who came into England with the Conqueror.
  His mother was Elizabeth Drake, who claimed a collateral connexion
  with the descendants of the illustrious Sir Francis Drake, the great
  navigator. Young Churchill received the rudiments of his education
  from the parish clergyman in Devonshire, from whom he imbibed that
  firm attachment to the Protestant faith by which he was ever
  afterwards distinguished, and which determined his conduct in the
  most important crisis of his life. He was afterwards placed at the
  school of St Paul&#39;s; and it was there that he first discovered,
  on reading Vegetius, that his bent of mind was decidedly for the
  military life. Like many other men destined for future distinction,
  he made no great figure as a scholar, a circumstance easily
  explained, if we recollect that it is on the knowledge of words that
  the reputation of a schoolboy, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6"
  id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> of things that of a man, is founded.
  But the despatches now published demonstrate that, before he attained
  middle life, he was a proficient at least in Latin, French, and
  English composition; for letters in each, written in a very pure
  style, are to be found in all parts of his correspondence.</p>

  <p>From early youth, young Churchill was distinguished by the
  elegance of his manners and the beauty of his countenance and
  figure&#8212;advantages which, coupled with the known loyal
  principles of his father, and the sufferings he had undergone in the
  royal cause, procured for him, at the early age of fifteen, the
  situation of page in the household of the Duke of York, afterwards
  James II. His inclination for arms was then so decided, that that
  prince procured for him a commission in one of the regiments of
  guards when he was only sixteen years old. His uncommonly handsome
  figure then attracted no small share of notice from the beauties of
  the court of Charles II., and even awakened a passion in one of the
  royal mistresses herself. Impatient to signalize himself, however, he
  left their seductions, and embarked as a volunteer in the expedition
  against Tangiers in 1766. Thus his first essay in arms was made in
  actions against the Moors. Having returned to Great Britain, he
  attracted the notice of the Countess of Castlemaine, afterwards
  Duchess of Cleveland, then the favorite mistress of Charles II., who
  had distinguished him by her regard before he embarked for Africa,
  and who made him a present of Â£5000, with which the young soldier
  bought an annuity of Â£500 a-year, which laid the foundation, says
  Chesterfield, of all his subsequent fortunes. Charles, to remove a
  dangerous rival in her unsteady affections, gave him a company in the
  guards, and sent him to the Continent with the auxiliary force which,
  in those days of English humiliation, the cabinet of St James&#39;s
  furnished to Louis XIV. to aid him in subduing the United Provinces.
  Thus, by a singular coincidence, it was under Turenne, CondÃ©, and
  Vauban that the future conqueror of the Bourbons first learned the
  art of scientific warfare. Wellington went through the same
  discipline, but in the inverse order: his first campaigns were made
  against the French in Flanders, his next against the bastions of
  Tippoo and the Mahratta horse in Hindostan.</p>

  <p>Churchill had not been long in Flanders, before his talents and
  gallantry won for him deserved distinction. The campaign of 1672,
  which brought the French armies to the gates of Amsterdam, and placed
  the United States within a hair&#39;s-breadth of destruction, was to
  him fruitful in valuable lessons. He distinguished himself afterwards
  so much at the siege of Nimeguen, that Turenne, who constantly called
  him by his <i>sobriquet</i> of &quot;the handsome Englishman,&quot;
  predicted that he would one day be a great man. In the following year
  he had the good fortune to save the life of his colonel, the Duke of
  Monmouth; and distinguished himself so much at the siege of
  Maestricht, that Louis XIV. publicly thanked him at the head of his
  army, and promised him his powerful influence with Charles II. for
  future promotion. He little thought what a formidable enemy he was
  then fostering at the court of his obsequious brother sovereign. The
  result of Louis XIV.&#39;s intercession was, that Churchill was made
  lieutenant-colonel; and he continued to serve with the English
  auxiliary force in Flanders, under the French generals, till 1677,
  when he returned with his regiment to London. Beyond all doubt it was
  these five years&#39; service under the great masters of the military
  art, who then sustained the power and cast a halo round the crown of
  Louis XIV., which rendered Marlborough the consummate commander that,
  from the moment he was placed at the head of the Allied armies, he
  showed himself to have become. One of the most interesting and
  instructive lessons to be learned from biography is the long steps,
  the vast amount of previous preparation, the numerous changes, some
  prosperous, others adverse, by which the mind of a great man is
  formed, and he is prepared for playing the important part he is
  intended to perform on the theatre of the world. Providence does
  nothing in vain, and when it has selected a particular mind for great
  achievement, the events which happen to it all seem to conspire in a
  mysterious way for its development. Were any one omitted, some
  essential quality in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id=
  "Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> character of the future hero, statesman,
  or philosopher would be found to be awanting.</p>

  <p>Here also, as in every other period of history, we may see how
  unprincipled ambition overvaults itself, and the measures which seem
  at first sight most securely to establish its oppressive reign, are
  the unseen means by which an overruling power works out its
  destruction. Doubtless the other ministers of Louis XIV. deemed their
  master&#39;s power secure when this English alliance was concluded;
  when the English monarch had become a state pensioner of the court of
  Versailles; when a secret treaty had united them by apparently
  indissoluble bonds; when the ministers equally and the patriots of
  England were corrupted by his bribes; when the dreaded fleets of
  Britain were to be seen in union with those of France, to break down
  the squadrons of an inconsiderable republic; when the descendants of
  the conquerors of Cressy, Poitiers, and Azincour stood side by side
  with the successors of the vanquished in those disastrous fields, to
  achieve the conquest of Flanders and Holland. Without doubt, so far
  as human foresight could go, Louvois and Colbert were right. Nothing
  could appear so decidedly calculated to fix the power of Louis XIV.
  on an immovable foundation. But how vain are the calculations of the
  greatest human intellects, when put in opposition to the overruling
  will of Omnipotence! It was that very English alliance which ruined
  Louis XIV., as the Austrian alliance and marriage, which seemed to
  put the keystone in the arch of his greatness, afterwards ruined
  Napoleon. By the effect, and one of the most desired effects, of the
  English alliance, a strong body of British auxiliaries were sent to
  Flanders; the English officers learned the theory and practice of war
  in the best of all schools, and under the best of all teachers; that
  ignorance of the military art, the result in every age of our insular
  situation, and which generally causes the four or five first years of
  every war to terminate in disaster, was for the time removed, and
  that mighty genius was developed under the eye of Louis XIV., and by
  the example of Turenne, which was destined to hurl back to their own
  frontiers the tide of Gallic invasion, and close in mourning the
  reign of the <i>Grande Monarque</i>. &quot;Les hommes agissent,&quot;
  says Bossuet, &quot;mais Dieu les mÃ¨ne.&quot;</p>

  <p>Upon Churchill&#39;s return to London, the brilliant reputation
  which had preceded, and the even augmented personal advantages which
  accompanied him, immediately rendered him the idol of beauty and
  fashion. The ladies of the palace vied for his homage&#8212;the
  nobles of the land hastened to cultivate his society. Like Julius
  CÃ¦sar, he was carried away by the stream, and plunged into the vortex
  of courtly dissipation with the ardour which marks an energetic
  character in the pursuit whether of good or evil. The elegance of his
  person and manners, and charms of his conversation, prevailed so far
  with Charles II. and the Duke of York, that soon after, though not
  yet thirty years of age, he obtained a regiment. In 1680 he married
  the celebrated Sarah Jennings, the favourite lady in attendance on
  the Princess Anne, second daughter of the Duke of York, one of the
  most admired beauties of the court, and this alliance increased his
  influence, already great, with that Prince, and laid the foundation
  of the future grandeur of his fortunes. Shortly after his marriage he
  accompanied the Duke of York to Scotland, in the course of which they
  both were nearly shipwrecked on the coast of Fife. On this occasion
  the Duke made the greatest efforts to preserve his favourite&#39;s
  life, and succeeded in doing so, although the danger was such that
  many of the Scottish nobles perished under his eye. On his return to
  London in 1682, he was presented by his patron to the King, who made
  him colonel of the third regiment of guards. When the Duke of York
  ascended the throne in 1685, on the demise of his brother, Churchill
  kept his place as one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber, and was
  raised to the rank of brigadier-general. He was sent by his sovereign
  to Paris to notify his accession to Louis XIV., and on his return he
  was created a peer by the title of Baron Churchill of Sandbridge in
  the county of Hertford&#8212;a title which he took from an estate
  there which he had acquired in right of his wife. On the revolt of
  the Duke of Monmouth, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id=
  "Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> he had an opportunity of showing at once
  his military ability, and, by a signal service, his gratitude to his
  benefactor. Lord Feversham had the command of the royal forces, and
  Churchill was his major-general. The general-in-chief, however, kept
  so bad a look-out, that he was on the point of being surprised and
  cut to pieces by the rebel forces, who, on this occasion at least,
  were conducted with ability. The general and almost all his officers
  were in their beds, and sound asleep, when Monmouth, at the head of
  all his forces, silently debouched out of his camp, and suddenly fell
  on the royal army. The rout would have been complete, and probably
  James II. dethroned, had not Churchill, whose vigilant eye nothing
  escaped, observed the movement, and hastily collected a handful of
  men, with whom he made so vigorous a resistance as gave time for the
  remainder of the army to form, and repel this well-conceived
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>Churchill&#39;s mind was too sagacious, and his knowledge of the
  feelings of the nation too extensive, not to be aware of the perilous
  nature of the course upon which James had adventured, in endeavouring
  to bring about, if not the absolute re-establishment of the Catholic
  religion, at least such a quasi-establishment of it as the people
  deemed, and probably with reason, was, with so aspiring a body of
  ecclesiastics, in effect the same thing. When he saw the headstrong
  monarch break through all bounds, and openly trample on the
  liberties, while he shocked the religious feelings, of his people, he
  wrote to him to point out, in firm but respectful terms, the danger
  of his conduct. He declared to Lord Galway, when James&#39;s
  innovations began, that if he persisted in his design of overturning
  the constitution and religion of his country, he would leave his
  service. So far his conduct was perfectly unexceptionable. Our first
  duty is to our country, our second only to our benefactor. If they
  are brought into collision, as they often are during the melancholy
  vicissitudes of a civil war, an honourable man, whatever it may cost
  him, has but one part to take. He must not abandon his public duty
  for his private feelings, but he must never betray official duty. If
  Churchill, perceiving the frantic course of his master, had withdrawn
  from his service, and then either taken no part in the revolution
  which followed, or even appeared in arms against him, the most
  scrupulous moralist could have discovered nothing reprehensible in
  his conduct. History has in every age applauded the virtue, while it
  has commiserated the anguish, of the elder Brutus, who sacrificed his
  sons to the perhaps too rigorous laws of his country.</p>

  <p>But Churchill did not do this, and thence has arisen an
  ineffaceable blot on his memory. He did not relinquish the service of
  the infatuated monarch; he retained his office and commands; but he
  employed the influence and authority thence derived, to ruin his
  benefactor. So far were the representations of Churchill from having
  inspired any doubts of his fidelity, that James, when the Prince of
  Orange landed, confided to him the command of a corps of five
  thousand men, destined to oppose his progress. At the very time that
  he accepted that command, he had, if we may believe his panegyrist
  Ledyard, signed a letter, along with several other peers, addressed
  to the Prince of Orange, inviting him to come over, and had actually
  concluded with Major-General Kirk, who commanded at Axminster, a
  convention, for the seizure of the king and giving him up to his
  hostile son-in-law. James was secretly warned that Churchill was
  about to betray him, but he refused to believe it of one from whom he
  had hitherto experienced such devotion, and was only wakened from his
  dream of security by learning that his favourite had gone over with
  the five thousand men whom he commanded to the Prince of Orange. Not
  content with this, it was Churchill&#39;s influence, joined to that
  of his wife, which is said to have induced James&#39;s own daughter,
  the Princess Anne, and Prince George of Denmark, to detach themselves
  from the cause of the falling monarch; and drew from that unhappy
  sovereign the mournful exclamation, &quot;My God! my very children
  have forsaken me.&quot; In what does this conduct differ from that of
  Labedoyere, who, at the head of the garrison of Grenoble, deserted to
  Napoleon when sent out to oppose him?&#8212; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> or
  Lavalette, who employed his influence, as postmaster under Louis
  XVIII., to forward the Imperial conspiracy?&#8212;or Marshal Ney,
  who, after promising at the court of the Tuileries to bring the
  ex-emperor back in an iron cage, no sooner reached the royal camp at
  Melun, than he issued a proclamation calling on the troops to desert
  the Bourbons, and mount the tricolor cockade? Nay, is not
  Churchill&#39;s conduct, in a moral point of view, worse than that of
  Ney; for the latter abandoned the trust reposed in him by a new
  master, forced upon an unwilling nation, to rejoin his old benefactor
  and companion in arms; but the former abandoned the trust reposed in
  him by his old master and benefactor, to range himself under the
  banner of a competitor for the throne, to whom he was bound neither
  by duty nor obligation. And yet such is often the inequality of
  crimes and punishments in this world, that Churchill was raised to
  the pinnacle of greatness by the very conduct which consigned Ney,
  with justice, so far as his conduct is concerned, to an ignominious
  death.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Treason ne&#39;er prospers; for when it
      does,</span> <span class="i2">None dare call it
      treason.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>History forgets its first and noblest duty when it fails, by its
  distribution of praise and blame, to counterbalance, so far as its
  verdict can, this inequality, which, for inscrutable but doubtless
  wise purposes, Providence has permitted in this transient scene.
  Charity forbids us to scrutinize such conduct too severely. It is the
  deplorable effect of a successful revolution, even when commenced for
  the most necessary purposes, to obliterate the ideas of man on right
  and wrong, and leave no other test in the general case for public
  conduct but success. It is its first effect to place them in such
  trying circumstances that none but the most confirmed and resolute
  virtue can pass unscathed through the ordeal. He knew the human heart
  well, who commanded us in our daily prayers to supplicate not to be
  led into temptation, even before asking for deliverance from evil.
  Let no man be sure, however much, on a calm survey, he may condemn
  the conduct of Marlborough and Ney, that in similar circumstances he
  would not have done the same.</p>

  <p>The magnitude of the service rendered by Churchill to the Prince
  of Orange, immediately appeared in the commands conferred upon him.
  Hardly was he settled at William&#39;s headquarters when he was
  dispatched to London to assume the command of the Horse Guards; and,
  while there, he signed, on the 20th December 1688, the famous Act of
  Association in favour of the Prince of Orange. Shortly after, he was
  named lieutenant-general of the armies of William, and immediately
  made a new organization of the troops, under officers whom he could
  trust, which proved of the utmost service to William on the unstable
  throne on which he was soon after seated. He was present at most of
  the long and momentous debates which took place in the House of Peers
  on the question on whom the crown should be conferred, and at first
  is said to have inclined to a regency; but with a commendable
  delicacy he absented himself on the night of the decisive vote on the
  vacancy of the throne. He voted, however, on the 6th of February for
  the resolution which settled the crown on William and Mary; and he
  assisted at their coronation, under the title of Earl of Marlborough,
  to which he had shortly before been elevated by William. England
  having, on the accession of the new monarch, joined the continental
  league against France, Marlborough received the command of the
  British auxiliary force in the Netherlands, and by his courage and
  ability contributed in a remarkable manner to the victory of
  Walcourt. In 1690 he received orders to return from Flanders in order
  to assume a command in Ireland, then agitated by a general
  insurrection in favour of James; but, actuated by some remnant of
  attachment to his old benefactor, he eluded on various pretences
  complying with the order, till the battle of the Boyne had
  extinguished the hopes of the dethroned monarch, when he came over
  and made himself master of Cork and Kinsale. In 1691 he was sent
  again into Flanders, in order to act under the immediate orders of
  William, who was then, with heroic constancy, contending with the
  still superior forces of France; but hardly had he landed there when
  he was arrested, deprived of all <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> his commands, and sent to
  the Tower of London, along with several of the noblemen of
  distinction in the British senate.</p>

  <p>Upon this part of the history of Marlborough there hangs a veil of
  mystery, which all the papers brought to light in more recent times
  have not entirely removed. At the time, his disgrace was by many
  attributed to some cutting sarcasms in which he had indulged on the
  predilection of William for the continental troops, and especially
  the Dutch; by others, to intrigues conducted by Lady Marlborough and
  him, to obtain for the Princess Anne a larger pension than the king
  was disposed to allow her. But neither of these causes are sufficient
  to explain the fall and arrest of so eminent a man as Marlborough,
  and who had rendered such important services to the newly-established
  monarch. It would appear from what has transpired in later times,
  that a much more serious cause had produced the rupture between him
  and William. The charge brought against him at the time, but which
  was not prosecuted, as it was found to rest on false or insufficient
  evidence, was that of having, along with Lords Salisbury, Cornbury,
  the Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Basil Ferebrace, signed the scheme
  of an association for the restoration of James. Sir John Fenwick, who
  was executed for a treasonable correspondence with James II. shortly
  after Marlborough&#39;s arrest, declared in the course of his trial
  that he was privy to the design, had received the pardon of the
  exiled monarch, and had engaged to procure for him the adhesion of
  the army. The Papers, published in Coxe, rather corroborate the view
  that he was privy to it; and it is supported by those found at Rome
  in the possession of Cardinal York.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
  "FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
  That Marlborough, disgusted with the partiality of William for his
  Dutch troops, and irritated at the open severity of his Government,
  should have repented of his abandonment of his former sovereign and
  benefactor, is highly probable. But it can scarcely be taken as an
  apology for one act of treason, that he meditated the commission of
  another. It only shows how perilous, in public as in private life, is
  any deviation from the path of integrity, that it impelled such a man
  into so tortuous and disreputable a path.</p>

  <p>Marlborough, however, was a man whose services were too valuable
  to the newly-established dynasty, for him to be permitted to remain
  long in disgrace. He was soon liberated, indeed, from the Tower, as
  no sufficient evidence of his alleged accession to the conspiracy had
  been obtained. Several years elapsed, however, before he emerged from
  the privacy into which he prudently retired on his liberation from
  confinement. Queen Mary having been carried off by the smallpox on
  the 17th of January 1696, Marlborough wisely abstained from even
  taking part in the debates which followed in Parliament, during which
  some of the malcontents dropped hints as to the propriety of
  conferring the crown on his immediate patroness, the Princess Anne.
  This prudent reserve, together with the absence of any decided proofs
  at the time of Marlborough&#39;s correspondence with James, seems to
  have at length weakened William&#39;s resentment, and by degrees he
  was taken back into favour. The peace of Ryswick, signed on the 20th
  of September 1697, having consolidated the power of that monarch,
  Marlborough was, on the 19th of June 1698, made preceptor of the
  young Duke of Gloucester, his nephew, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> son of the Princess Anne,
  and heir-presumptive to the throne; and this appointment, which at
  once restored his credit at court, was accompanied by the gracious
  expression&#8212;&quot;My lord, make my nephew to resemble yourself,
  and he will be every thing which I can desire.&quot; On the same day
  he was re-appointed to his rank as a privy councillor, and took the
  oaths and his seat accordingly. So fully had he now regained the
  confidence of William, that he was three times named one of the nine
  lords justiciars to whom the administration of affairs in Great
  Britain was subsequently entrusted, during the temporary absence of
  William in Holland; and the War of the Succession having become
  certain in the year 1700, that monarch, who was preparing to take an
  active part in it, appointed Marlborough, on 1st June 1701, his
  ambassador-extraordinary at the Hague, and commander-in-chief of the
  Allied forces in Flanders. This double appointment in effect invested
  Marlborough with the entire direction of affairs civil and military,
  so far as England was concerned, on the Continent. William, who was
  highly indignant at the recognition of the Chevalier St George as
  King of England, on the death of his father James II., in September
  1701, was preparing to prosecute the war with the vigour and
  perseverance which so eminently distinguished his character, when he
  was carried off by the effects of a fall from his horse, on the 19th
  March 1702. But that event made no alteration in the part which
  England took in the war which was commencing, and it augmented rather
  than diminished the influence which Marlborough had in its direction.
  The Princess Anne, with whom, both individually and through Lady
  Marlborough, he was so intimately connected, mounted the throne
  without opposition; and one of her first acts was to bestow on
  Marlborough the order of the Garter, confirm him in his former
  offices, and appoint him, in addition, her plenipotentiary at the
  Hague. War was declared on the 15th May 1702, and Marlborough
  immediately went over to the Netherlands to take the command of the
  Allied army, sixty thousand strong, then lying before Nimeguen, which
  was threatened by a superior force on the part of the French.</p>

  <p>It is at this period&#8212;time 1702&#8212;that the great and
  memorable, and withal blameless period of Marlborough&#39;s life
  commenced; the next ten years were one unbroken series of efforts,
  victories, and glory. He arrived in the camp at Nimeguen on the
  evening of the 2d July, having been a few weeks before at the Hague;
  and immediately assumed the command. Lord Athlone, who had previously
  enjoyed that situation, at first laid claim to an equal authority
  with him; but this ruinous division, which never is safe, save with
  men so great as he and Eugene, and would unquestionably have proved
  ruinous to the common cause if shared with Athlone, was prevented by
  the States-General, who insisted upon the undivided direction being
  conferred on Marlborough. Most fortunately it is precisely at this
  period that the correspondence now published commences, which, in the
  three volumes already published, presents an unbroken series of his
  letters to persons of every description down to May, 1708. They thus
  embrace the early successes in Flanders, the cross march into Bavaria
  and battle of Blenheim, the expulsion of the French from Germany, the
  battle of Ramillies, and taking of Brussels and Antwerp, the mission
  to the King of Sweden at Dresden, the battle of Almanza, in Spain,
  and all the important events of the first six years of the war. More
  weighty and momentous materials for history never were presented to
  the public; and their importance will not be properly appreciated, if
  the previous condition of Europe, and imminent hazard to the
  independence of all the adjoining states, from the unmeasured
  ambition, and vast power of Louis XIV., is not taken into
  consideration.</p>

  <p>Accustomed as we are to regard the Bourbons as a fallen and
  unfortunate race, the objects rather of commiseration than
  apprehension, and Napoleon as the only sovereign who has really
  threatened our independence, and all but effected the subjugation of
  the Continent, we can scarcely conceive the terror with which a
  century and a half ago they, with reason, inspired all Europe, or the
  narrow escape which the continental states, at least, then made from
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg
  12]</a></span> being all reduced to the condition of provinces of
  France. The forces of that monarchy, at all times formidable to its
  neighbours, from the warlike spirit of its inhabitants, and their
  rapacious disposition, conspicuous alike in the earliest and the
  latest times;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> its central situation,
  forming, as it were, the salient angle of a bastion projecting into
  the centre of Germany; and its numerous population&#8212;were then,
  in a peculiar manner, to be dreaded, from their concentration in the
  hands of an able and ambitious monarch, who had succeeded for the
  first time, for two hundred years, in healing the divisions and
  stilling the feuds of its nobles, and turned their buoyant energy
  into the channel of foreign conquest. Immense was the force which, by
  this able policy, was found to exist in France, and terrible the
  danger which it at once brought upon the neighbouring states. It was
  rendered the more formidable in the time of Louis XIV., from the
  extraordinary concentration of talent which his discernment or good
  fortune had collected around his throne, and the consummate talent,
  civil and military, with which affairs were directed. Turenne,
  Boufflers, and CondÃ©, were his generals; Vauban was his engineer,
  Louvois and Torcy were his statesmen. The lustre of the exploits of
  these illustrious men, in itself great, was much enhanced by the
  still greater blaze of fame which encircled his throne, from the
  genius of the literary men who have given such immortal celebrity to
  his reign. Corneille and Racine were his tragedians; MoliÃ¨re wrote
  his comedies; Bossuet, FÃ©nÃ©lon, and Bourdaloue were his theologians;
  Massillon his preacher, Boileau his critic; Le Notre laid out his
  gardens; Le Brun painted his halls. Greatness had come upon France,
  as, in truth, it does to most other states, in all departments at the
  same time; and the adjoining nations, alike intimidated by a power
  which they could not resist, and dazzled by a glory which they could
  not emulate, had come almost to despair of maintaining their
  independence; and were sinking into that state of apathy, which is at
  once the consequence and the cause of extraordinary reverses.</p>

  <p>The influence of these causes had distinctly appeared in the
  extraordinary good fortune which had attended the enterprises of
  Louis, and the numerous conquests he had made since he had launched
  into the career of foreign aggrandizement. Nothing could resist his
  victorious arms. At the head of an army of an hundred thousand men,
  directed by Turenne, he speedily overran Flanders. Its fortified
  cities yielded to the science of Vauban, or the terrors of his name.
  The boasted barrier of the Netherlands was passed in a few weeks;
  hardly any of its far-famed fortresses made any resistance. The
  passage of the Rhine was achieved under the eyes of the monarch with
  little loss, and melodramatic effect. One half of Holland was soon
  overrun, and the presence of the French army at the gates of
  Amsterdam seemed to presage immediate destruction to the United
  Provinces; and but for the firmness of their leaders, and a fortunate
  combination of circumstances, unquestionably would have done so. The
  alliance with England, in the early part of his reign, and the
  junction of the fleets of Britain and France to ruin their fleets and
  blockade their harbours, seemed to deprive them of their last
  resource, derived from their energetic industry. Nor were substantial
  fruits awanting from these conquests. Alsace and Franche ComtÃ© were
  overrun, and, with Lorraine, permanently annexed to the French
  monarchy; and although, by the peace of Nimeguen, part of his
  acquisitions in Flanders was abandoned, enough was retained by the
  devouring monarchy to deprive the Dutch of the barrier they had so
  ardently desired, and render their situation to the last degree
  precarious, in the neighbourhood of so formidable a power. The heroic
  William, indeed, had not struggled in vain for the independence of
  his country. The distant powers of Europe, at length wakened to a
  sense of their danger, had made strenuous efforts to coerce the
  ambition of France; the revolution of 1688 had restored England to
  its natural <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg
  13]</a></span> place in the van of the contest for continental
  freedom; and the peace of Ryswick in 1697 had in some degree seen the
  trophies of conquests more equally balanced between the contending
  parties. But still it was with difficulty that the alliance kept its
  ground against Louis&#8212;any untoward event, the defection of any
  considerable power, would at once, it was felt, cast the balance in
  his favour; and all history had demonstrated how many are the chances
  against any considerable confederacy keeping for any length of time
  together, when the immediate danger which had stilled their
  jealousies, and bound together their separate interests, is in
  appearance removed. Such was the dubious and anxious state of Europe,
  when the death of Charles II. at Madrid, on the 1st November 1700,
  and the bequest of his vast territories to Philip Duke of Anjou,
  second son of the Dauphin, and grandson of Louis XIV., threatened at
  once to place the immense resources of the Castilian monarchy at the
  disposal of the ambitious monarch of France, whose passion for glory
  had not diminished with his advanced years, and whose want of
  moderation was soon evinced by his accepting, after an affected
  hesitation, the splendid bequest.</p>

  <p>Threatened with so serious a danger, it is not surprising that the
  powers of Europe were in the utmost alarm, and erelong took steps to
  endeavour to avert it. Such, however, was the terror inspired by the
  name of Louis XIV., and the magnitude of the addition made by this
  bequest to his power, that the new monarch, in the first instance,
  ascended the throne of Spain and the Indies without any opposition.
  The Spanish Netherlands, so important both from their intrinsic
  riches, their situation as the certain theatre of war, and the
  numerous fortified towns with which they were studded, had been early
  secured for the young Bourbon prince by the Elector of Bavaria, who
  was at that time the governor of those valuable possessions.
  Sardinia, Naples, Sicily, the Milanese, and the other Spanish
  possessions in Italy, speedily followed the example. The distant
  colonies of the crown of Castile, in America and the Indies, sent in
  their adhesion. The young Prince of Anjou made his formal entry into
  Spain in the beginning of 1701, and was crowned at Madrid under the
  title of Philip V. The principal continental powers, with the
  exception of the Emperor, acknowledged his title to the throne. The
  Dutch were in despair: they beheld the power of Louis XIV. brought to
  their very gates. Flanders, instead of being the barrier of Europe
  against France, had become the outwork of France against Europe. The
  flag of Louis XIV. floated on Antwerp, Brussels, and Ghent. Italy,
  France, Spain, and Flanders, were united in one close league, and in
  fact formed but one dominion. It was the empire of Charlemagne over
  again, directed with equal ability, founded on greater power, and
  backed by the boundless treasures of the Indies. Spain had threatened
  the liberties of Europe in the end of the sixteenth century: France
  had all but proved fatal to them in the close of the seventeenth.
  What hope was there of being able to make head against them both,
  united under such a head as Louis XIV.?</p>

  <p>Great as these dangers were, however, they had no effect in
  daunting the heroic spirit of William III. In concert with the
  Emperor, and the United Provinces, who were too nearly threatened to
  be backward in falling into his views, he laboured for the formation
  of a great confederacy, which might prevent the union of the crowns
  of France and Castile in one family, and prevent, before it was too
  late, the consolidation of a power which threatened to be so
  formidable to the liberties of Europe. The death of that intrepid
  monarch in March 1702, which, had it taken place earlier, might have
  prevented the formation of the confederacy, as it was, proved no
  impediment, but rather the reverse. His measures had been so well
  taken, his resolute spirit had laboured with such effect, that the
  alliance, offensive and defensive, between the Emperor, England, and
  Holland, had been already signed. The accession of the Princess Anne,
  without weakening its bonds, added another power, of no mean
  importance, to its ranks. Her husband, Prince George of Denmark,
  brought the forces of that kingdom to aid the common cause. Prussia
  soon after followed the example. On the other hand, Bavaria, closely
  connected <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
  14]</a></span> with the French and Spanish monarchies, both by
  jealousy of Austria, and the government of the Netherlands, which its
  Elector held, adhered to France. Thus the forces of Europe were
  mutually arrayed and divided, much as they afterwards were in the
  coalition against Napoleon in 1813. It might already be foreseen,
  that Flanders, the Bavarian plains, Spain, and Lombardy, would, as in
  the great contest which followed a century after, be the theatre of
  war. But the forces of France and Spain possessed this advantage,
  unknown in former wars, but immense in a military point of view, that
  they were in possession of the whole of the Netherlands, the numerous
  fortresses of which were alike valuable as a basis of offensive
  operations, and as affording asylums all but impregnable in cases of
  disaster. The Allied generals, whether they commenced their
  operations in Flanders or on the side of Germany, had to begin on the
  Rhine, and cut their way through the long barrier of fortresses with
  which the genius of Vauban and Cohorn had encircled the frontiers of
  the monarchy.</p>

  <p>War having been resolved on, the first step was taken by the
  Emperor, who laid claim to Milan as a fief of the empire, and
  supported his pretensions by moving an army into Italy under the
  command of Prince Eugene of Savoy, who afterwards became so
  celebrated as the brother and worthy rival of Marlborough in arms.
  The French and Spaniards assembled an army in the Milanese to resist
  his advance; and the Duke of Mantua having joined the cause, that
  important city was garrisoned by the French troops. But Prince Eugene
  erelong obliged them to fall back from the banks of the Adige to the
  line of the Oglio, on which they made a stand. But though hostilities
  had thus commenced in Italy, negotiations were still carried on at
  the Hague; though unhappily the pretensions of the French king were
  found to be of so exorbitant a character, that an accommodation was
  impossible. Marlborough&#39;s first mission to the Continent,
  however, after the accession of Anne, was of a diplomatic character;
  and it was by his unwearied efforts, suavity of manner, and singular
  talents for negotiation, that the difficulties which attend the
  formation of all such extensive confederacies were overcome. And it
  was not till war was declared, on 4th May 1702, that he first took
  the command as commander-in-chief of the Allied armies.</p>

  <p>The first operation of the Allies was an attack on the small fort
  of Kaiserworth, on the right bank of the Rhine, which belonged to the
  Elector of Cologne, which surrendered on the 15th May. The main
  French army, nominally under the direction of the Duke of Burgundy,
  really of Marshal Boufflers, entered the Duchy of Cleves in the end
  of the same month, and soon became engaged with the Allied forces,
  which at first, being inferior in numbers, fell back. Marlborough
  reached headquarters when the French lay before Nimeguen; and the
  Dutch trembled for that frontier town. Reinforcements, however,
  rapidly came in from all quarters to join the Allied army; and
  Marlborough, finding himself at the head of a gallant force sixty
  thousand strong, resolved to commence offensive operations. His first
  operation was the siege of Venloo, which was carried by storm on the
  18th September, after various actions in the course of the siege.
  &quot;My Lord Cutts,&quot; says Marlborough, &quot;commanded at one
  of the breaches; and the English grenadiers had the honour of being
  the first that entered the fort.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id=
  "FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
  Ruremonde was next besieged; and the Allies, steadily advancing,
  opened the navigation of the Meuse as far as Maestricht. Stevenswart
  was taken on the 1st October; and, on the 6th, Ruremonde surrendered.
  Liege was the next object of attack; and the breaches of the citadel
  were, by the skilful operations of Cohorn, who commanded the Allied
  engineers and artillery, declared practicable on the 23d of the same
  month. The assault was immediately ordered; and &quot;by the
  extraordinary bravery,&quot; says Marlborough, &quot;of the officers
  and soldiers, the citadel was carried by storm; and, for the honour
  of her Majesty&#39;s subjects, the English were the first that got
  upon the breach.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id=
  "FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
  15]</a></span> So early in this, as in every other war where
  ignorance and infatuation has not led them into the field, did the
  native-born valour of the Anglo-Saxon race make itself known! Seven
  battalions and a half were made prisoners on this occasion; and so
  disheartened was the enemy by the fall of the citadel, that the
  castle of the Chartreuse, with its garrison of 1500 men, capitulated
  a few days afterwards. This last success gave the Allies the entire
  command of Liege, and concluded this short but glorious campaign, in
  the course of which they had made themselves masters by main force,
  in presence of the French army, of four fortified towns, conquered
  all Spanish Guelderland, opened the Meuse as far as Maestricht,
  carried the strong castles of Liege by storm, advanced their
  standards from the Rhine far into Flanders, and become enabled to
  take up their winter quarters in the enemy&#39;s territory, amidst
  its fertile fields.</p>

  <p>The campaign being now concluded, and both parties having gone
  into winter quarters, Marlborough embarked on the Meuse to return to
  London, where his presence was much required to steady the authority
  and direct the cabinet of the Queen, who had so recently taken her
  seat on the throne. When dropping down the Meuse, in company of the
  Dutch commissioners, he was made prisoner by a French partisan, who
  had made an incursion into those parts; and owed his escape to the
  presence of mind of a servant named Gill, who, unperceived, put into
  his master&#39;s hands an old passport in the name of General
  Churchill. The Frenchman, intent only on plunder, seized all the
  plate and valuables in the boat, and made prisoners the small
  detachment of soldiers who accompanied them; but, ignorant of the
  inestimable prize within his grasp, allowed the remainder of the
  party, including Marlborough, to proceed on their way. On this
  occasion, it may truly be said, the boat carried CÃ¦sar and his
  fortunes. He arrived in safety at the Hague, where the people, who
  regarded him as their guardian angel, and had heard of his narrow
  escape, received him with the most enthusiastic acclamations. From
  thence, having concerted the plan with the Dutch government for the
  ensuing campaign, he crossed over to London, where his reception by
  the Queen and nation was of the most gratifying description. Her
  Majesty conferred on him the title of Duke of Marlborough and Marquis
  of Blandford, and sent a message to the House of Commons, suggesting
  a pension to him of Â£5000 a-year, secured on the revenue of the
  post-office; but that House refused to consent to the alienation of
  so considerable a part of the public revenue. He was amply
  compensated, however, for this disappointment, by the enthusiastic
  reception he met with from all classes of the nation, which, long
  unaccustomed to military success, at least in any cause in which it
  could sympathize, hailed with transports of joy this first revival of
  triumph in support of the Protestant faith, and over that power with
  whom, for centuries, they had maintained so constant a rivalry.</p>

  <p>The campaign of 1703 was not fruitful of great events. Taught, by
  the untoward issue of the preceding one, the quality of the general
  and army with whom he had to contend, the French general cautiously
  remained on the defensive; and so skilfully were the measures of
  Marshal Boufflers taken, that all the efforts of Marlborough were
  unable to force him to a general action. The war in Flanders was thus
  limited to one of posts and sieges; but in that the superiority of
  the Allied arms was successfully asserted, Parliament having been
  prevailed on to consent to an augmentation of the British contingent.
  But a treaty having been concluded with Sweden, and various
  reinforcements having been received from the lesser powers,
  preparations were made for the siege of Bonn, on the Rhine, a
  frontier town of Flanders, of great importance from its commanding
  the passage of that artery of Germany, and stopping, while in the
  enemy&#39;s hands, all transit of military stores or provisions for
  the use of the armies in Bavaria, or on the Upper Rhine. The
  batteries opened with seventy heavy guns and English mortars on the
  14th May 1704; a vigorous sortie with a thousand foot was repulsed,
  after having at first gained some success, on the following day, and
  on the 16th two breaches having been declared practicable, the
  garrison surrendered at discretion. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> After this success, the
  army moved against Huys, and it was taken with its garrison of 900
  men on the 23d August. Marlborough and the English generals, after
  this success, were decidedly of opinion that it would be advisable at
  all hazard to attempt forcing the French lines, which were strongly
  fortified between Mehaigne and Leuwe, and a strong opinion to that
  effect was transmitted to the Hague on the very day after the fall of
  Huys.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> They alleged with reason,
  that the Allies being superior in Flanders, and the French having the
  upper hand in Germany and Italy, it was of the utmost importance to
  follow up the present tide of success in the only quarter where it
  flowed in their favour, and counterbalance disasters elsewhere, by
  decisive events in the quarter where it was most material to obtain
  it. The Dutch government, however, set on getting a barrier for
  themselves, could not be brought to agree to this course, how great
  soever the advantages which it promised, and insisted instead, that
  he should undertake the siege of Limbourg, which lay open to attack.
  This was accordingly done; the trenches were commenced in the middle
  of September, and the garrison capitulated on the 27th of the same
  month: a poor compensation for the total defeat of the French army,
  which would in all probability have ensued if the bolder plan of
  operation he had so earnestly counselled had been adopted.<a name=
  "FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class=
  "fnanchor">[8]</a> This terminated the campaign of 1703, which,
  though successful, had led to very different results from what might
  have been anticipated if Marlborough&#39;s advice had been followed,
  and an earlier victory of Ramillies laid open the whole Flemish
  plains. Having dispatched eight battalions to reinforce the Prince of
  Hesse, who had sustained serious disaster on the Moselle, he had an
  interview with the Archduke Charles, whom the Allies had acknowledged
  as King of Spain, who presented him with a magnificent sword set with
  diamonds, and set out for the Hague, from whence he again returned to
  London to concert measures for the ensuing campaign, and stimulate
  the British government to the efforts necessary for its successful
  prosecution.</p>

  <p>But while success had thus attended all the operations of the
  Allies in Flanders, where the English contingent acted, and
  Marlborough had the command, affairs had assumed a very different
  aspect in Germany and Italy. The French were there superior alike in
  the number and quality of their troops, and, in Germany at least, in
  the skill with which they were commanded. Early in June, Marshal
  Tallard assumed the command of the French forces in Alsace, passed
  the Rhine at Strasburg on the 16th July, took Brissac on the 7th
  September, and invested Landau on the 16th October. The Allies, under
  the Prince of Hesse, attempted to raise the siege, but were defeated
  with considerable loss; and, soon after, Landau surrendered, thus
  terminating with disaster the campaign on the Upper Rhine. Still more
  considerable were the disasters sustained in Bavaria. Marshal Villars
  there commanded, and at the head of the French and Bavarians,
  defeated General Stirum, who headed the Imperialists, on the 20th
  September. In December, Marshal Marsin, who had succeeded Villars in
  the command, made himself master of the important city of Augsburg,
  and in January 1704 the Bavarians got possession of Passau.
  Meanwhile, a formidable insurrection had broken out in Hungary,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
  17]</a></span> which so distracted the cabinet of Vienna, that that
  capital itself seemed to be threatened by the combined forces of the
  French and Bavarians after the fall of Passau. No event of importance
  took place in Italy during the campaign; Count Strahremberg, who
  commanded the Imperial forces, having with great ability forced the
  Duke de VendÃ´me, who was at the head of a superior body of French
  troops, to retire. But in Bavaria and on the Danube, it was evident
  that the Allies were overmatched; and to the restoration of the
  balance in that quarter, the anxious attention of the confederates
  was turned during the winter of 1703-4. The dangerous state of the
  Emperor and the empire awakened the greatest solicitude at the Hague,
  as well as unbounded terror at Vienna, from whence the most urgent
  representations were made on the necessity of reinforcements being
  sent from Marlborough to their support. But though this was agreed to
  by England and Holland, so straitened were the Dutch finances, that
  they were wholly unable to form the necessary magazines to enable the
  Allies to commence operations. Marlborough, during the whole of
  January and February 1704, was indefatigable in his efforts to
  overcome these difficulties; and the preparations having at length
  been completed, it was agreed by the States, according to a plan of
  the campaign laid down by Marlborough, that he himself should proceed
  into Bavaria with the great body of the Allied army in Flanders,
  leaving only an army of observation there, to restrain any incursion
  which the French troops might attempt during his absence.</p>

  <p>Marlborough began his march with the great body of his forces on
  the 8th May, and crossing the Meuse at Maestricht, proceeded with the
  utmost expedition towards the Rhine by Bedbourg and Kirpen, and
  arrived at Bonn on the 22d May. Meanwhile, the French were also
  powerfully reinforcing their army on the Danube. Early in the same
  month 26,000 men joined the Elector of Bavaria, while Villeroi with
  the army of Flanders was hastening in the same direction. Marlborough
  having obtained intelligence of these great additions to the
  enemy&#39;s forces in the vital quarter, wrote to the States-General,
  that unless they promptly sent him succour, the Emperor would be
  entirely ruined.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Meanwhile, however, relying
  chiefly on himself, he redoubled his activity and diligence.
  Continuing his march up the Rhine by Coblentz and Cassel, opposite
  Mayence, he crossed the Necker near Ladenbourg on the 3d June. From
  thence he pursued his march without intermission by Mundelshene,
  where he had, on the 10th June, his first interview with Prince
  Eugene, who had been called from Italy to co-operate in stemming the
  torrent of disaster in Germany. From thence he advanced by Great
  Heppach to Langenau, and first came in contact with the enemy on the
  2d July, on the Schullenberg, near Donawert. Marlborough, at the head
  of the advanced guard of nine thousand men, there attacked the French
  and Bavarians, 12,000 strong, in their intrenched camp, which was
  extremely strong, and after a desperate resistance, aided by an
  opportune attack by the Prince of Baden, who commanded the
  Emperor&#39;s forces, carried the intrenchments, with the whole
  artillery which they mounted, and the loss of 7000 men and thirteen
  standards to the vanquished. He was inclined to venture upon this
  hazardous attempt by having received intelligence on the same day
  from Prince Eugene, that Marshals Villeroi and Tallard, at the head
  of fifty battalions, and sixty squadrons of their best troops, had
  arrived at Strasburg, and were using the utmost diligence to reach
  the Bavarian forces through the defiles of the Black Forest.</p>

  <p>This brilliant opening of the German campaign was soon followed by
  substantial results. A few days after <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> Rain surrendered, Aicha was
  carried by assault; and, following up his career of success,
  Marlborough advanced to within a league of Augsburg, under the cannon
  of which the Elector of Bavaria was placed with the remnant of his
  forces, in a situation too strong to admit of its being forced. He
  here made several attempts to detach the Elector, who was now reduced
  to the greatest straits, from the French alliance; but that prince,
  relying on the great army, forty-five thousand strong, which Marshal
  Tallard was bringing up to his support from the Rhine, adhered with
  honourable fidelity to his engagements. Upon this, Marlborough took
  post near Friburg, in such a situation as to cut him off from all
  communication with his dominions; and ravaged the country with his
  light troops, levying contributions wherever they went, and burning
  the villages with savage ferocity as far as the gates of Munich. Thus
  was avenged the barbarous desolation of the Palatinate, thirty years
  before, by the French army under the orders of Marshal Turenne.
  Overcome by the cries of his suffering subjects, the Elector at
  length consented to enter into a negotiation, which made some
  progress; but the rapid approach of Marshal Tallard with the French
  army through the Black Forest, caused him to break it off, and hazard
  all on the fortune of war. Unable to induce the Elector, by the
  barbarities unhappily, at that time, too frequent on all sides in
  war, either to quit his intrenched camp under the cannon of Augsburg,
  or abandon the French alliance, the English general undertook the
  siege of Ingolstadt; he himself with the main body of the army
  covering the siege, and Prince Louis of Baden conducting the
  operations in the trenches. Upon this, the Elector of Bavaria broke
  up from his strong position, and, abandoning with heroic resolution
  his own country, marched to Biberbach, where he effected his junction
  with Marshal Tallard, who now threatened Prince Eugene with an
  immediate attack. No sooner had he received intelligence of this,
  than Marlborough, on the 10th of August, sent the Duke of Wirtemburg
  with twenty-seven squadrons of horse to reinforce the prince; and
  early next morning detached General Churchill with twenty battalions
  across the Danube, to be in a situation to support him in case of
  need. He himself immediately after followed, and joined the Prince
  with his whole army on the 11th. Every thing now presaged decisive
  events. The Elector had boldly quitted Bavaria, leaving his whole
  dominions at the mercy of the enemy, except the fortified cities of
  Munich and Augsburg, and periled his crown upon the issue of war at
  the French headquarters; while Marlborough and Eugene had united
  their forces, with a determination to give battle in the heart of
  Germany, in the enemy&#39;s territory, with their communications
  exposed to the utmost hazard, under circumstances where defeat could
  be attended with nothing short of total ruin.</p>

  <p>The French and Bavarian army consisted of fifty-five thousand men,
  of whom nearly forty-five thousand were French troops, the very best
  which the monarchy could produce. Marlborough and Eugene had
  sixty-six battalions and one hundred and sixty squadrons, which, with
  the artillery, might be about fifty thousand combatants. The forces
  on the opposite sides were thus nearly equal in point of numerical
  amount; but there was a wide difference in their composition.
  Four-fifths of the French army were national troops, speaking the
  same language, animated by the same feelings, accustomed to the same
  discipline, and the most of whom had been accustomed to act together.
  The Allies, on the other hand, were a motley assemblage, like
  Hannibal&#39;s at CannÃ¦, or Wellington&#39;s at Waterloo, composed of
  the troops of many different nations, speaking different languages,
  trained to different discipline, but recently assembled together, and
  under the orders of a stranger general, one of those haughty
  islanders, little in general inured to war, but whose cold or
  supercilious manners had so often caused jealousies to arise in the
  best cemented confederacies. English, Prussians, Danes,
  Wirtemburgers, Dutch, Hanoverians, and Hessians, were blended in such
  nearly equal proportions, that the arms of no one state could be said
  by its numerical preponderance to be entitled to the precedence. But
  the consummate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id=
  "Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> address, splendid talents, and
  conciliatory manners of Marlborough, as well as the brilliant valour
  which the English auxiliary force had displayed on many occasions,
  had won for them the lead, as they had formerly done when in no
  greater force among the confederates under Richard C&#339;ur-de-Lion
  in the Holy War. It was universally felt that upon them, as the Tenth
  Legion of CÃ¦sar, or the Old Guard of Napoleon, the weight of the
  contest at the decisive moment would fall. The army was divided into
  two <i>corps-d&#39;armÃ©e</i>; the first commanded by the duke in
  person, being by far the strongest, destined to bear the weight of
  the contest, and carry in front the enemy&#39;s position. These two
  corps, though co-operating, were at such a distance from each other,
  that they were much in the situation of the English and Prussians at
  Waterloo, or Napoleon and Ney&#39;s corps at Bautzen. The second,
  under Prince Eugene, which consisted chiefly of cavalry, was much
  weaker in point of numerical amount, and was intended for a
  subordinate attack, to distract the enemy&#39;s attention from the
  principal onset in front under Marlborough.<a name="FNanchor_10_10"
  id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class=
  "fnanchor">[10]</a> With ordinary officers, or even eminent generals
  of a second order, a dangerous rivalry for the supreme command would
  unquestionably have arisen, and added to the many seeds of division
  and causes of weakness which already existed in so multifarious an
  array. But these great men were superior to all such petty
  jealousies. Each, conscious of powers to do great things, and proud
  of fame already acquired, was willing to yield what was necessary for
  the common good to the other. They had no rivalry, save a noble
  emulation who should do most for the common cause in which they were
  jointly engaged. From the moment of their junction it was agreed that
  they should take the command of the whole army day about; and so
  perfectly did their views on all points coincide, and so entirely did
  their noble hearts beat in unison, that during eight subsequent
  campaigns that they for the most part acted together, there was never
  the slightest division between them, nor any interruption of the
  harmony with which the operations of the Allies were conducted.</p>

  <p>The French position was in places strong, and their disposition
  for resistance at each point where they were threatened by attack
  from the Allied forces, judicious; but there was a fatal defect in
  its general conception. Marshal Tallard was on the right, resting on
  the Danube, which secured him from being turned in that quarter,
  having the village of <span class='smcap'>Blenheim</span> in his
  front, which was strongly garrisoned by twenty-six battalions and
  twelve squadrons, all native French troops. In the centre was the
  village of Oberglau, which was occupied by fourteen battalions, among
  whom were three Irish corps of celebrated veterans. The communication
  between Blenheim and Oberglau was kept up by a screen consisting of
  eighty squadrons, in two lines, having two brigades of foot,
  consisting of seven battalions, in its centre. The left, opposite
  Prince Eugene, was under the orders of Marshal Marsin, and consisted
  of twenty-two battalions of infantry and thirty-six squadrons,
  consisting for the most part of Bavarians and Marshal Marsin&#39;s
  men, posted in front of the village of Lutzingen. Thus the French
  consisted of sixty-nine battalions and a hundred and thirty-four
  squadrons, and were posted in a line strongly supported at each
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
  20]</a></span> extremity, but weak in the centre, and with the wings,
  where the great body of the infantry was placed, at such a distance
  from each other, that, if the centre was broken through, each ran the
  risk of being enveloped by the enemy, without the other being able to
  render them any assistance. This danger as to the troops in Blenheim,
  the flower of their army, was much augmented by the circumstance,
  that if their centre was forced where it was formed of cavalry only,
  and the victors turned sharp round towards Blenheim, the horse would
  be driven headlong into the Danube, and the foot in that village
  would run the hazard of being surrounded or pushed into that river,
  which was not fordable, even for horse, in any part. But though these
  circumstances would, to a far-seeing general, have presaged serious
  disaster in the event of defeat, yet the position was strong in
  itself, and the French generals, long accustomed to victory, had some
  excuse for not having taken sufficiently into view the contingencies
  likely to occur in the event of defeat. Both the villages at the
  extremity of their line had been strengthened, not only with
  intrenchments hastily thrown up around them, thickly mounted with
  heavy cannon, but with barricades at all their principal entrances,
  formed of overturned carts and all the furniture of the houses, which
  they had seized upon, as the insurgents did at Paris in 1830, for
  that purpose. The army stood upon a hill or gentle eminence, the guns
  from which commanded the whole plain by which alone it could be
  approached; and this plain was low, and intersected on the right, in
  front of Blenheim, by a rivulet which flows down by a gentle descent
  to the Danube, and in front of Oberglau by another rivulet, which
  runs in two branches till within a few paces of the Danube; into
  which it also empties itself. These rivulets had bridges over them at
  the points where they flowed through villages; but they were
  difficult of passage in the other places for cavalry and artillery,
  and, with the ditches cut in the swampy meadows through which they
  flowed, proved no small impediment to the advance of the Allied
  army.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Marlborough, before the action began, in person
  visited each important battery, in order to ascertain the range of
  the guns. The troops under his command were drawn up in four lines;
  the infantry being in front, and the cavalry behind, in each line.
  This arrangement was adopted in order that the infantry, which would
  get easiest through the streams, might form on the other side, and
  cover the formation of the cavalry, who might be more impeded. The
  fire of cannon soon became very animated on both sides, and the
  infantry advanced to the edge of the rivulets with that cheerful air
  and confident step which is so often the forerunner of success. On
  Prince Eugene&#39;s side the impediments, however, proved serious;
  the beds of the rivulets were so broad, that they required to be
  filled up with fascines before they could be passed by the guns; and
  when they did get across, they replied without much effect to the
  French cannon thundering from the heights, which commanded the whole
  field. At half-past twelve, however, these difficulties were, by
  great efforts on the part of Prince Eugene and his wing, overcome,
  and he sent word to Marlborough that he was ready. The English
  general instantly called for his horse; the troops every where stood
  to their arms, and the signal was given to advance. The rivulets and
  marshy ground in front of Blenheim and Unterglau were passed by the
  first line without much difficulty, though under a heavy fire of
  artillery from the French batteries; and the firm ground on the slope
  being reached, the first line advanced in the finest order to the
  attack&#8212;the cavalry in front having now defiled to a side, so as
  to let the English infantry take the lead. The attack must be given
  in the words of Dr Hare&#39;s Journal.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Lord Cutts made the first attack upon Blenheim, with the
    English grenadiers. Brigadier-general Rowe led up his brigade,
    which formed the first line, and was sustained in the second by a
    brigade of Hessians. Rowe was within thirty paces of the palisades
    about Blenheim when the enemy gave their first fire, by which a
    great many officers and men fell; but notwithstanding this, that
    brave officer marched direct up to the pales, on which he struck
    his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
    21]</a></span> sword before he allowed his men to fire. His orders
    were to enter at the point of the bayonet; but the superiority of
    the enemy, and the strength of their post, rendered this
    impossible. The first line was therefore forced to retire; Rowe was
    struck down badly wounded at the foot of the pales; his
    lieut.-colonel and major were killed in endeavouring to bring him
    off, and some squadrons of French gens-d&#39;armes having charged
    the brigade while retiring in disorder, it was partially broken,
    and one of the colours of Rowe&#39;s regiment was taken. The
    Hessians in the second line upon this advanced briskly forward,
    charged the squadrons, retook the colour, and repulsed them. Lord
    Cutts, however, seeing fresh squadrons coming down upon him, sent
    to request some cavalry should be sent to cover his flank. Five
    British squadrons accordingly were moved up, and speedily charged
    by eight of the enemy; the French gave their fire at a little
    distance, but the English charged sword in hand, and put them to
    the rout. Being overpowered, however, by fresh squadrons, and
    galled by the fire which issued from the enclosures of Blenheim,
    our horse were driven back in their turn, and recoiled in
    disorder.<br />
    &quot;Marlborough, foreseeing that the enemy would pursue this
    advantage, resolved to bring his whole cavalry across the rivulets.
    The operation was begun by the English horse. It proved more
    difficult, however, than was expected, especially to the English
    squadrons; as they had to cross the rivulet where it was divided,
    and the meadows were very soft. However, they surmounted those
    difficulties, and got over; but when they advanced, they were so
    severely galled by the infantry in Blenheim firing upon their
    flank, while the cavalry charged them in front, that they were
    forced to retire, which they did, under cover of Bulow and
    Bothmer&#39;s German dragoons, who succeeded them in the passage.
    Marlborough, seeing the enemy resolute to maintain the ground
    occupied by his cavalry, gave orders for the whole remainder of his
    cavalry to pass wherever they could get across. There was very
    great difficulty and danger in defiling over the rivulet in the
    face of an enemy, already formed and supported by several batteries
    of cannon; yet by the brave examples and intrepidity of the
    officers, they were at length got over, and kept their ground on
    the other side. Bulow stretched across, opposite to Oberglau, with
    the Danish and Hanoverian horse; but near that village they were so
    vigorously charged by the French cavalry, that they were driven
    back. Rallying, they were again led to the charge, and again routed
    with great slaughter by the charges of the horse in front, and the
    dreadful fire from the inclosures of Blenheim. Nor did the attack
    on Oberglau to the British right, under Prince Holstein, succeed
    better; no sooner had he passed the rivulet, than the Irish
    veterans, posted there, came pouring down upon them, took the
    prince prisoner, and threw the whole into confusion. Upon this,
    Marlborough galloped to the spot at the head of some squadrons,
    followed by three battalions, which had not yet been engaged. With
    the horse he charged the Irish battalions in flank, and forced them
    back; the foot he posted himself, and having re-established affairs
    at that point, returned rapidly to the left, where he found the
    whole of his corps passed over the streams, and on firm ground on
    the other side. The horse were drawn up in two lines fronting the
    enemy; the foot in two lines behind them; and some guns, under
    Colonel Blood, having been hurried across by means of pontoons,
    were brought to bear upon some battalions of foot which were
    intermingled with the enemy&#39;s horse, and made great havoc in
    their ranks.<br />

    <p>&quot;It was now past three, and the Duke, having got his whole men
    ready for the attack, sent to Prince Eugene to know if he was ready
    to support him. But the efforts of that gallant prince had not been
    attended with the same success. In the first onset, indeed, his
    Danish and Prussian infantry had gained considerable success, and
    taken six guns, and the Imperial cavalry had, by a vigorous charge,
    broken the first line of the enemy&#39;s horse; but they failed in
    their attack on the second line, and were driven back to their
    original ground; whereupon the Bavarian cavalry, rushing forward,
    enveloped Eugene&#39;s foot, who were forced to retire, and with
    difficulty regained their original ground. Half an hour afterwards,
    Prince Eugene made a second attack with his horse; but they were
    again repulsed by the bravery of the Bavarian cavalry, and driven
    for refuge into the wood, in the rear of their original position.
    Nothing daunted by this bad success, the Prince formed his troops
    for a third attack, and himself led his cavalry to the charge; but
    so vigorous was the defence, that they were again repulsed to the
    wood, and the victorious <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22"
    id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> enemy&#39;s dragoons with loud
    cheers charged the Prussian foot in flank, and were only repelled
    by the admirable steadiness with which they delivered their fire,
    and stood their ground with fixed bayonets in front.<br />

    <p>&quot;About five the general forward movement was made which
    determined the issue of this great battle, which till then had
    seemed doubtful. The Duke of Marlborough, having ridden along the
    front, gave orders to sound the charge, when all at once our lines
    of horse moved on, sword in hand, to the attack. Those of the enemy
    presented their carbines at some distance and fired; but they had
    no sooner done so than they wheeled about, broke, and fled. The
    gens-d&#39;armes fled towards Hochstedt, which was about two miles
    in the rear; the other squadrons towards the village of
    Sondersheim, which was nearer, and on the bank of the Danube. The
    Duke ordered General Hompesch, with thirty squadrons, to pursue
    those who fled to Hochstedt; while he himself, with Prince Hesse
    and the whole remainder of the cavalry, drove thirty of the
    enemy&#39;s squadrons headlong down the banks of the Danube, which,
    being very steep, occasioned the destruction of the greater part.
    Vast numbers endeavoured to save themselves by swimming, and
    perished miserably. Among the prisoners taken here were Marshal
    Tallard and his suite, who surrendered to M. Beinenbourg,
    aid-de-camp to the Prince of Hesse. Marlborough immediately desired
    him to be accommodated with his coach, and sent a pencil note to
    the duchess<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id=
    "FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
    "fnanchor">[11]</a> to say the victory was gained. Others, seeing
    the fate of their comrades in the water, endeavoured to save
    themselves by defiling to the right, along its margin, towards
    Hochstedt, but they were met and intercepted by some English
    squadrons; upon seeing which they fled in utter confusion towards
    Morselingen, and did not again attempt to engage. The victorious
    horse upon this fell upon several of the enemy&#39;s battalions,
    who had nearly reached Hochstedt, and cut them to pieces.<br />

    <p>&quot;Meanwhile Prince Eugene, by a fourth attack, succeeded in
    driving the Elector of Bavaria from his position; and the Duke,
    seeing this, sent orders to the squadrons in pursuit, towards
    Morselingen, to wheel about and join him. All this while the troops
    in Blenheim had been incessantly attacked, but it still held out
    and gave employment to the Duke&#39;s infantry. The moment the
    cavalry had beaten off that of the enemy, and cleared the field
    between the two villages of them, General Churchill moved both
    lines of foot upon the village of Blenheim, and it was soon
    surrounded so as to cut off all possibility of escape except on the
    side next the Danube. To prevent the possibility of their escape
    that way, Webb, with the Queen&#39;s regiment, took possession of a
    barrier the enemy had constructed to cover their retreat, and,
    having posted his men across the street which led to the Danube,
    several hundreds of the enemy, who were attempting to make their
    escape that way, were made prisoners. The other issue to the Danube
    was occupied in the same manner by Prince George&#39;s regiment:
    all who came out that way were made prisoners or driven into the
    Danube. Some endeavoured to break out at other places, but General
    Wood, with Lord John Hay&#39;s regiment of <i>grey</i> dragoons
    (Scots Greys) immediately advanced towards them, and, cantering up
    to the top of a rising ground, made them believe they had a larger
    force behind them, and stopped them on that side. When Churchill
    saw the defeat of the enemy&#39;s horse decided, he sent to request
    Lord Cutts to attack them in front, while he himself attacked them
    in flank. This was accordingly done; the Earl of Orkney and General
    Ingoldesby entering the village at the same time, at two different
    places, at the head of their respective regiments. But so vigorous
    was the resistance made by the enemy, especially at the churchyard,
    that they were forced to retire. The vehement fire, however, of the
    cannon and howitzers, which set fire to several barns and houses,
    added to the circumstance of their commander, M. Clerambault,
    having fled, and their retreat on all sides being cut off, led to
    their surrendering at discretion, to the number of six-and-twenty
    battalions. Thus concluded this great battle, in which the enemy
    had 5900 more than the Allies,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=
    "FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class=
    "fnanchor">[12]</a> and the advantage of a very strong position,
    difficult of attack.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id=
    "FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class=
    "fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
  </div><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg
  23]</a></span>

  <p>In this battle Marlborough&#39;s wing lost 3000 men, and
  Eugene&#39;s the same number, in all 6000. The French lost 13,000
  prisoners, including 1200 officers, almost all taken by
  Marlborough&#39;s wing, besides 34 pieces of cannon, 26 standards,
  and 90 colours; Eugene took 13 pieces. The killed and wounded were
  14,000 more. But the total loss of the French and Bavarians,
  including those who deserted during their calamitous retreat through
  the Black Forest, was not less than 40,000 men,<a name=
  "FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"
  class="fnanchor">[14]</a> a number greater than any which they
  sustained till the still more disastrous day of Waterloo.</p>

  <p>This account of the battle, which is by far the best and most
  intelligible which has ever yet been published, makes it quite
  evident to what cause the overwhelming magnitude of this defeat to
  the French army was owing. The strength of the position consisted
  solely in the rivulets and marshy grounds in its front; when they
  were passed, the error of Marshal Tallard&#39;s disposition of his
  troops was at once apparent. The infantry was accumulated in useless
  numbers in the villages. Of the twenty-six battalions in Blenheim,
  twenty were useless, and could not get into action, while the long
  line of cavalry from thence to Oberglau was sustained only by a few
  battalions of foot, incapable of making any effective resistance.
  This was the more inexcusable, as the French, having sixteen
  battalions of infantry more than the Allies, should at no point have
  shown themselves inferior in foot soldiers to their opponents. When
  the curtain of horse which stretched from Blenheim to Oberglau was
  broken through and driven off the field, the 13,000 infantry
  accumulated in the former of these villages could not avoid falling
  into the enemy&#39;s hands; for they were pressed between
  Marlborough&#39;s victorious foot and horse on the one side, and the
  unfordable stream of the Danube on the other. But Marlborough, it is
  evident, evinced the capacity of a great general in the manner in
  which he surmounted these obstacles, and took advantage of these
  faulty dispositions; resolutely, in the first instance, overcoming
  the numerous impediments which opposed the passage of the rivulets,
  and then accumulating his horse and foot for a grand attack on the
  enemy&#39;s centre, which, besides destroying above half the troops
  assembled there, and driving thirty squadrons into the Danube, cut
  off, and isolated the powerful body of infantry now uselessly crowded
  together in Blenheim, and compelled them to surrender.</p>

  <p>Immense were the results of this transcendent victory. The French
  army, lately so confident in its numbers and prowess, retreated
  &quot;or rather fled,&quot; as Marlborough says, through the Black
  Forest; abandoning the Elector of Bavaria and all the fortresses on
  the Danube to their fate. In the deepest dejection, and the utmost
  disorder, they reached the Rhine, scarce twelve thousand strong, on
  the 25th August, and immediately began defiling over by the bridge of
  Strasburg. How different from the triumphant army, which with drums
  beating, and colours flying, had crossed at the same place six weeks
  before! Marlborough, having detached part of his force to besiege
  Ulm, drew near with the bulk of his army to the Rhine, which he
  passed near Philipsburg on the 6th September, and soon after
  commenced the siege of Landau, on the French side; Prince Louis with
  20,000 men forming the besieging force, and Eugene and Marlborough
  with 30,000 the covering army. Ulm surrendered on the 16th September,
  with 250 pieces of cannon, and 1200 barrels of powder, which gave the
  Allies a solid foundation on the Danube, and effectually crushed the
  power of the Elector of Bavaria, who, isolated now in the midst of
  his enemies, had no alternative but to abandon his dominions, and
  seek refuge in Brussels, where he arrived in the end of September.
  Meanwhile, as the siege of Landau was found to require more time than
  had been anticipated, owing to the extraordinary <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
  difficulties experienced in getting up supplies and forage for the
  troops; Marlborough repaired to Hanover and Berlin to stimulate the
  Prussian and Hanoverian cabinets to greater exertions in the common
  cause, and he succeeded in making arrangements for the addition of
  8000 more Prussian troops to their valuable auxiliary force, to be
  added to the army of the Imperialists in Italy, which stood much in
  need of reinforcement. The Electress of Bavaria, who had been left
  Regent of that State in the absence of the Elector in Flanders, had
  now no resource left but submission; and a treaty was accordingly
  concluded in the beginning of November, by which she agreed to
  disband all her troops. Trarbach was taken in the end of December;
  the Hungarian insurrection was appeased; Landau capitulated in the
  beginning of the same month; a diversion which the enemy attempted on
  TrÃªves was defeated by Marlborough&#39;s activity and vigilance, and
  that city put in a sufficient posture of defence; and the campaign
  being now finished, that accomplished commander returned to the
  Hague, and London, to receive the honour due for his past services,
  and urge their respective cabinets to the efforts necessary to turn
  them to good account.</p>

  <p>Thus by the operations of one single campaign was Bavaria crushed,
  Austria and Germany delivered. Marlborough&#39;s cross-march from
  Flanders to the Danube, had extricated the Imperialists from a state
  of the utmost peril, and elevated them at once to security, victory,
  and conquest. The decisive blow struck at Blenheim, resounded through
  every part of Europe; it at once destroyed the vast fabric of power
  which it had taken Louis XIV., aided by the talents of Turenne, and
  the genius of Vauban, so long to construct. Instead of proudly
  descending the valley of the Danube, and threatening Vienna, as
  Napoleon afterwards did in 1805 and 1809, the French were driven in
  the utmost disorder across the Rhine. The surrender of Trarbach and
  Landau gave the Allies a firm footing on the left bank of that river.
  The submission of Bavaria deprived the French of that great outwork,
  of which they have made such good use in their German wars, the
  Hungarian insurrection, deprived of the hoped-for aid from the armies
  on the Rhine, was pacified. Prussia was induced by this great triumph
  to co-operate in a more efficient manner in the common cause; the
  parsimony of the Dutch gave way before the tumult of success; and the
  empire, delivered from invasion, was preparing to carry its
  victorious arms into the heart of France. Such results require no
  comment; they speak for themselves, and deservedly place Marlborough
  in the very highest rank of military commanders. The campaigns of
  Napoleon exhibit no more decisive or glorious results.</p>

  <p>Honours and emoluments of every description were showered on the
  English hero for this glorious success. He was created a prince of
  the Holy Roman empire,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id=
  "FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class=
  "fnanchor">[15]</a> and a tract of land in Germany erected into a
  principality in his favour. His reception at the courts of Berlin and
  Hanover resembled that of a sovereign prince; the acclamations of the
  people, in all the towns through which he passed, rent the air; at
  the Hague his influence was such that he was regarded as the real
  Stadtholder. More substantial rewards awaited him in his own country.
  The munificence of the queen and the gratitude of Parliament
  conferred upon him the extensive honour and manor of Woodstock, long
  a royal palace, and once the scene of the loves of Henry II. and the
  fair <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
  25]</a></span> Rosamond. By order of the Queen, not only was this
  noble estate settled on the duke and his heirs, but the royal
  comptroller commenced a magnificent palace for the duke on a scale
  worthy of his services and England&#39;s gratitude. From this origin
  the superb palace of Blenheim has taken its rise; which, although not
  built in the purest taste, or after the most approved models,
  remains, and will long remain, a splendid monument of a nation&#39;s
  gratitude, and of the genius of Vanbrugh.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the invaluable services thus rendered by
  Marlborough, both to the Emperor of Germany and the Queen of England,
  he was far from experiencing from either potentate that liberal
  support for the future prosecution of the war, which the inestimable
  opportunity now placed in their hands, and the formidable power still
  at the disposal of the enemy so loudly required. As usual, the
  English Parliament were exceedingly backward in voting supplies
  either of men or money; nor was the cabinet of Vienna inclined to be
  more liberal in its exertions. Though the House of Commons agreed to
  give Â£4,670,000 for the service of the ensuing year; yet the land
  forces voted were only 40,000 men, although the population of Great
  Britain and Ireland could not be at that period under ten millions,
  while France, with about twenty millions, had above two hundred
  thousand under arms. It is this excessive and invariable reluctance
  of the English Parliament ever to make those efforts at the
  commencement of a war, which are necessary to turn to a good account
  the inherent bravery of its soldiers and frequent skill of its
  commanders, that is the cause of the long duration of our Continental
  wars, and of three-fourths of the national debt which now oppresses
  the empire, and, in its ultimate results, will endanger its
  existence. The national forces are, by the cry for economy and
  reduction which invariably is raised in peace, reduced to so low an
  ebb, that it is only by successive additions, made in many different
  years, that it can be raised up to any thing like the amount
  requisite for successful operations. Thus disaster generally occurs
  in the commencement of every war; or if, by the genius of any
  extraordinary commander, as by that of Marlborough, unlooked-for
  success is achieved in the outset, the nation is unable to follow it
  up; the war languishes for want of the requisite support; the enemy
  gets time to recover from his consternation; his danger stimulates
  him to greater exertions; and many long years of warfare, deeply
  checkered with disaster, and attended with an enormous expense, are
  required to obviate the effects of previous undue pacific
  reduction.</p>

  <p>How bitterly Marlborough felt this want of support, on the part of
  the cabinets both of London and Vienna, which prevented him from
  following up the victory of Blenheim with the decisive operations
  against France which he would otherwise have undoubtedly commenced,
  is proved by various parts of his correspondence. On the 16th of
  December 1704, he wrote to Mr Secretary Harley&#8212;&quot;I am sorry
  to see nothing has been offered yet, <i>nor any care taken by
  Parliament for recruiting the army</i>. I mean chiefly the foot. It
  is of that consequence for an early campaign, that without it <i>we
  may run the hazard of losing, in a great measure, the fruits of the
  last</i>; and therefore, pray leave to recommend it to you to advise
  with your friends, if any proper method can be thought of, that may
  be laid before the House immediately, without waiting my
  arrival.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id=
  "FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class=
  "fnanchor">[16]</a> Nor was the cabinet of Vienna, notwithstanding
  the imminent danger they had recently run, more active in making the
  necessary efforts to repair the losses of the
  campaign&#8212;&quot;You cannot,&quot; says Marlborough, &quot;say
  more to us of the <i>supine negligence of the Court of Vienna</i>,
  with reference to your affairs, <i>than we are sensible of every
  where else</i>; and certainly if the Duke of Savoy&#39;s good conduct
  and bravery at Verue had not reduced the French to a very low ebb,
  the game must have been over before any help could come to
  you.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It is ever thus,
  especially with states such as Great Britain, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> in which
  the democratic element is so powerful as to imprint upon the measures
  of government that disregard of the future, and aversion to present
  efforts or burdens, which is the invariable characteristic of the
  bulk of mankind. If Marlborough had been adequately supported and
  strengthened after the decisive blow struck at Blenheim; that is, if
  the governments of Vienna and London, with that of the Hague, had by
  a great and timely effort doubled his effective force when the French
  were broken and disheartened by defeat, he would have marched to
  Paris in the next campaign, and dictated peace to the <i>Grand
  Monarque</i> in his gorgeous halls of Versailles. It was
  short-sighted economy which entailed upon the nations the costs and
  burdens of the next ten years of the War of the Succession, as it did
  the still greater costs and burdens of the Revolutionary War, after
  the still more decisive success of the Allies in the summer of 1793,
  when the iron frontier of the Netherlands was entirely broken
  through, and their advanced posts, without any force to oppose them,
  were within an hundred and sixty miles of Paris.</p>

  <p>This parsimony of the Allied governments, and their invincible
  repugnance to the efforts and sacrifices which could alone bring, and
  certainly would have brought, the war to an early and glorious issue,
  is the cause of the subsequent conversion of the war into one of
  blockades and sieges, and of its being transferred to Flanders, where
  its progress was necessarily slow, and cost enormous, from the vast
  number of strongholds which required to be reduced at every stage of
  the Allied advance. It was said at the time, that in attacking
  Flanders in that quarter, Marlborough took the bull by the horns;
  that France on the side of the Rhine was far more vulnerable, and
  that the war was fixed in Flanders, in order by protracting it to
  augment the profits of the generals employed. Subsequent writers, not
  reflecting on the difference of the circumstances, have observed the
  successful issue of the invasions of France from Switzerland and the
  Upper Rhine in 1814, and Flanders and the Lower Rhine in 1815, and
  concluded that a similar result would have attended a like bold
  invasion under Marlborough and Eugene. There never was a greater
  mistake. The great object of the war was to wrest Flanders from
  France; when the lilied standard floated on Brussels and Antwerp, the
  United Provinces were constantly in danger of being swallowed up, and
  there was no security for the independence either of England,
  Holland, or any of the German States. If Marlborough and Eugene had
  had two hundred thousand effective men at their disposal, as
  Wellington and Blucher had in 1815, or three hundred thousand, as
  Schwartzenberg and Blucher had in 1814, they would doubtless have
  left half their force behind them to blockade the fortresses, and
  with the other half marched direct to Paris. But as they had never
  had more than eighty thousand on their muster-rolls, and could not
  bring at any time more than sixty thousand effective men into the
  field, this bold and decisive course was impossible. The French army
  in their front was rarely inferior to theirs, often superior; and how
  was it possible in these circumstances to adventure on the perilous
  course of pushing on into the heart of the enemy&#39;s territory,
  leaving the frontier fortresses, yet unsubdued, in their rear? The
  disastrous issue of the Blenheim campaign to the French arms, even
  when supported by the friendly arms and all the fortresses of
  Bavaria, in the preceding year, had shown what was the danger of such
  a course. The still more calamitous issue of the Moscow campaign to
  the army of Napoleon, demonstrated that even the greatest military
  talents, and most enormous accumulation of military force, affords no
  security against the incalculable danger of an undue advance beyond
  the base of military operations. The greatest generals of the last
  age, fruitful beyond all others in military talent, have acted on
  those principles, whenever they had not an overwhelming superiority
  of forces at their command. Wellington never invaded Spain till he
  was master of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajos; nor France till he had
  subdued St Sebastian and Pampeluna. The first use which Napoleon made
  of his victories at Montenotte and Dego was to compel the Court of
  Turin to surrender <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id=
  "Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> all their fortresses in Piedmont; of the
  victory of Marengo, to force the Imperialists to abandon the whole
  strongholds of Lombardy as far as the Adige. The possession of the
  single fortress of Mantua in 1796, enabled the Austrians to stem the
  flood of Napoleon&#39;s victories, and gain time to assemble four
  different armies for the defence of the monarchy. The case of half a
  million of men, flushed by victory, and led by able and experienced
  leaders assailing a single state, is the exception, not the rule.</p>

  <p>Circumstances, therefore, of paramount importance and irresistible
  force, compelled Marlborough to fix the war in Flanders, and convert
  it into one of sieges and blockades. In entering upon such a system
  of hostility, sure, and comparatively free from risk, but slow and
  extremely costly, the alliance ran the greatest risk of being
  shipwrecked on the numerous discords, jealousies, and separate
  interests, which, in almost every instance recorded in history, have
  proved fatal to a great confederacy, if it does not obtain decisive
  success at the outset, before these seeds of division have had time
  to come to maturity. With what admirable skill and incomparable
  address Marlborough kept together the unwieldy alliance will
  hereafter appear. Never was a man so qualified by nature for such a
  task. He was courtesy and grace personified. It was a common saying
  at the time, that neither man nor woman could resist him. &quot;Of
  all the men I ever knew,&quot; says no common man, himself a perfect
  master of the elegances he so much admired, &quot;the late Duke of
  Marlborough possessed the graces in the highest degree, not to say
  engrossed them. Indeed he got the most by them, and contrary to the
  custom of profound historians, who always assign deep causes for
  great events, I ascribe the better half of the Duke of
  Marlborough&#39;s greatness to those graces. He had no brightness,
  nothing shining in his genius. He had most undoubtedly an excellent
  plain understanding, and sound judgment. But these qualities alone
  would probably have never raised him higher than they found him,
  which was page to James the Second&#39;s queen. But there the grace
  protected and promoted him. His figure was beautiful, but his manner
  was irresistible, either by man or woman. It was by this engaging,
  graceful manner, that he was enabled, during all his war, to connect
  the various and jarring powers of the Grand Alliance, and to carry
  them on to the main object of the war, notwithstanding their private
  and separate views, jealousies, and wrongheadedness. Whatever court
  he went to (and he was often obliged to go to restive and refractory
  ones) he brought them into his measures. The pensionary Heinsius, who
  had governed the United Provinces for forty years, was absolutely
  governed by him. He was always cool, and nobody ever observed the
  least variation in his countenance; he could refuse more gracefully
  than others could grant, and those who went from him the most
  dissatisfied as to the substance of their business, were yet charmed
  by his manner, and, as it were, comforted by it.&quot;<a name=

    Specimens of his Lyrics.

  <div class='smcapcenter'>
    Translated From The Original Russian, By Thomas B. Shaw, B.A. Of
    Cambridge, Adjunct Professor Of English Literature In The Imperial
    Alexander Lyceum, Translator Of &quot;The Heretic,&quot;&amp;c.
    &amp;c.
  </div>

  <p>In offering to the public the following specimens of PÃºshkin&#39;s
  poetry in an English dress, the translator considers it part of his
  duty to make a few remarks. The number and extent of these
  observations, he will, of course, confine within the narrowest limits
  consistent with his important duty of making his countrymen
  acquainted with the style and character of Russia&#39;s greatest
  poet; a duty which he would certainly betray, were he to omit to
  explain the chief points indispensable for the true understanding,
  not only of the extracts which he has selected as a sample of his
  author&#39;s productions, but of the general tone and character of
  those productions, viewed as a whole.</p>

  <p>The translator wishes it therefore to be distinctly understood
  that he by no means intends to offer, in the character of a complete
  poetical portrait, the few pieces contained in these pages, but
  rather as an attempt, however imperfect, to daguerreotype&#8212;by
  means of the most faithful translation consistent with
  ease&#8212;<i>one</i> of the various expressions of PÃºshkin&#39;s
  literary physiognomy; to represent one phase of his developement.</p>

  <p>That physiognomy is a very flexible and a varying one; PÃºshkin
  (considered only as a <i>poet</i>) must be allowed to have attained
  very high eminence in various walks of his sublime art; his works are
  very numerous, and as diverse in their form as in their spirit; he is
  sometimes a romantic, sometimes a legendary, sometimes an epic,
  sometimes a satiric, and sometimes a dramatic poet;&#8212;in most, if
  not in all, of these various lines he has attained the highest
  eminence as yet recognised by his countrymen; and, consequently,
  whatever impression may be made upon our readers by the present essay
  at a transfusion of his works into the English language, will be
  necessarily a very imperfect one. In the prosecution of the arduous
  but not unprofitable enterprise which the translator set before
  himself three years ago&#8212;viz. the communication to his
  countrymen of some true ideas of the scope and peculiar character of
  Russian literature&#8212;he met with so much discouragement in the
  unfavourable predictions of such of his friends as he consulted with
  respect to the feasibility of his project, that he may be excused for
  some degree of timidity in offering the results of his labours to an
  English public. So great, indeed, was that timidity, that not even
  the very flattering reception given to his two first attempts at
  prose translation, has entirely succeeded in destroying it; and he
  prefers, on the present occasion, to run the risk of giving only a
  partial and imperfect reflection of PÃºshkin&#39;s intellectual
  features, to the danger that might attend a more ambitious and
  elaborate version of any of the poet&#39;s longer works.</p>

  <p>PÃºshkin is here presented solely in his <i>lyrical</i> character;
  and, it is trusted, that, in the selection of the compositions to be
  translated&#8212;selections made from a very large number of highly
  meritorious works&#8212;due attention has been paid not only to the
  intrinsic beauty and merit of the pieces chosen, but also to the
  important consideration which renders indispensable (in cases where
  we find an <i>embarras de richesses</i>, and where the merit is
  equal) the adoption of such specimens as would possess the greatest
  degree of novelty for an English reader.</p>

  <p>The task of translating all PÃºshkin&#39;s poetry is certainly too
  dignified a one, not to excite our ambition; and it is meditated, in
  the event of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=
  "Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> accompanying versions finding in England
  a degree of approbation sufficiently marked to indicate a desire for
  more specimens, to extend our present labours so far, as to admit
  passages of the most remarkable merit from PÃºshkin&#39;s longer
  works; and, perhaps, even complete versions of some of the more
  celebrated. Should, therefore, the British public give the
  <i>fiat</i> of its approbation, we would still further contribute to
  its knowledge of the great Russian author, by publishing, for
  example, some of the more remarkable <i>places</i> in the poem of
  &quot;EvgÃ©nii OniÃ©gin,&quot; the charming &quot;Gypsies,&quot; scenes
  and passages from the tragedy of &quot;BÃ³ris GodunÃ³ff,&quot; the
  &quot;Prisoner of the Caucasus,&quot; &quot;MazÃ©pa,&quot; &amp;c.
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>With respect to the present or <i>lyrical</i> specimens, we shall
  take the liberty to make a few remarks, having reference to the
  principles which have governed the translator in the execution of the
  versions; and we shall afterwards preface each poem with a few words
  of notice, such as may appear to be rendered necessary either by the
  subject or by the form of the composition itself.</p>

  <p>Of the poetical merit of these translations, considered as English
  poems, their writer has no very exalted idea; of their
  <i>faithfulness as versions</i>, on the contrary, he has so deep a
  conviction, that he regrets exceedingly the fact, that the universal
  ignorance prevailing in England of the Russian language, will prevent
  the possibility of that important merit&#8212;strict
  fidelity&#8212;being tested by the British reader. Let the indulgent,
  therefore, remember, if we have in any case left an air of stiffness
  and constraint but too perceptible in our work, that this fault is to
  be considered as a sacrifice of grace at the altar of truth. It would
  have been not only possible, but easy, to have spun a collection of
  easy rhymes, bearing a general resemblance to the vigorous and
  passionate poetry of PÃºshkin; but this would not have been a
  <i>translation</i>, and a translation it was our object to produce.
  Bowring&#39;s <i>Russian Anthology</i> (not to speak of his other
  volumes of translated poetry) is a melancholy example of the danger
  of this attractive but fatal system; while the names of Cary, of Hay,
  and of Merivale, will remain as a bright encouragement to those who
  have sufficient strength of mind to prefer the &quot;strait and
  narrow way&quot; of masterly <i>translation</i>, to the &quot;flowery
  paths of dalliance&quot; so often trodden by the
  <i>paraphraser</i>.</p>

  <p>In all cases, the metre of the original, the musical movement and
  modulation, has, as far as the translator&#39;s ear enabled him to
  judge, been followed with minute exactness, and at no inconsiderable
  expense, in some cases, of time and labour. It would be superfluous,
  therefore, to state, that the number of lines in the English version
  is always the same as in the original. It has been our study,
  wherever the differences in the structure of the two languages would
  permit, to include the same thoughts in the same number of lines.
  There is also a peculiarity of the Russian language which frequently
  rendered our task still more arduous; and the conquest of this
  difficulty has, we trust, conferred upon us the right to speak of our
  triumph without incurring the charge of vanity. We allude to the
  great abundance in the Russian of double terminations, and the
  consequent recurrence of double rhymes, a peculiarity common also to
  the Italian and Spanish versification, and one which certainly
  communicates to the versification of those countries a character so
  marked and peculiar, that no translator would be justified in
  neglecting it. As it would be impossible, without the use of Russian
  types, to give our readers an example of this from the writings of
  PÃºshkin, and as they would be unable to pronounce such a quotation
  even if they saw it, we will give an illustration of what we mean
  from the Spanish and the Italian.</p>

  <p>The first is from the fourth book of the <i>Galatea</i> of
  Cervantes&#8212;</p>

  <p>In the two passages here quoted, it will be observed that all the
  lines end with two syllables, in both of which the rhyme is engaged;
  and an English version of the above verses, however faithful in other
  respects, which should omit to use the same species of double
  termination, and content itself with the monosyllable rhyme, would
  indubitably lose some of the harmony of the original. These double
  rhymes are far from abundant in our monosyllabic language; but we
  venture to affirm, that their conscientious employment would be found
  so valuable, as to amply repay the labour and difficulty attending
  their search.</p>

  <p>We trust that our readers will pardon the apparent technicality of
  these remarks, for the sake of the consideration which induced us to
  make them. In all translation, even in the best, there is so great a
  loss of spirit and harmony, that the conscientious labourer in this
  most difficult and ungrateful art, should never neglect even the most
  trifling precaution that tends to hinder a still further depreciation
  of the gold of his original; not to mention the principle, that
  whatever it is worth our while to do at all, it is assuredly worth
  our while to do as well as we can.</p>
  <hr style='width: 45%;' />

  <p>The first specimen of PÃºshkin&#39;s lyric productions which we
  shall present to our countrymen, &quot;done into English,&quot; as
  Jacob Tonson was wont to phrase it, &quot;by an eminent hand,&quot;
  is a production considered by the poet&#39;s critics to possess the
  very highest degree of merit in its peculiar style. We have mentioned
  some details respecting the nature and history of the Imperial Lyceum
  of TsarskoÃ« SelÃ³, in which PÃºshkin was educated, and we have
  described the peculiar intensity of feeling with which all who
  quitted its walls looked back upon the happy days they had spent
  within them, and the singular ardour and permanency of the
  friendships contracted beneath its roof. On the anniversary of the
  foundation (by the Emperor Alexander) of the institution, it is
  customary for all the &quot;old Lyceans&quot; to dine together, in
  the same way as the Eton, Harrow, or Rugby men are accustomed to
  unite once a-year in honour of their school. On many of these
  occasions PÃºshkin contributed to the due celebration of the event by
  producing poems of various lengths, and different degrees of merit;
  we give here the best of these. It was written during the poet&#39;s
  residence in the government of Pskoff, and will be found, we think, a
  most beautiful and touching embodiment of such feelings as would be
  suggested in the mind of one obliged to be absent from a ceremony of
  the nature in question. Of the comrades whose names PÃºshkin has
  immortalized in these lines, it is only necessary to specify that the
  first, KorsÃ¡koff, distinguished among his youthful comrades for his
  musical talents, met with an early death in Italy; a circumstance to
  which the poet has touchingly alluded. MatiÃºshkin is now an admiral
  of distinction, and is commanding the Russian squadron in the Black
  Sea. Of the two whom he mentions as having passed the anniversary
  described in this poem (October 19, 1825) in his company, the first
  was PÃºstchin, since dead, and the second the Prince GortchakÃ³ff, whom
  he met by accident, travelling in the neighbourhood of his (the
  poet&#39;s) seclusion. Our readers cannot fail, we think, to be
  struck with the beautiful passage consecrated to his friendship with
  DÃ©lvig; and the only other personal allusion which seems to stand in
  need of explanation, is that indicated <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> by the name Wilhelm,
  towards the end of the poem. This is the Christian name of his friend
  KÃ¼chelbecher, since dead, and whose family name was hardly harmonious
  enough to enter PÃºshkin&#39;s line, and was therefore omitted on the
  Horatian principle&#8212;&quot;versu quod dicere nolim.&quot; We now
  hasten to present the lines.</p>

  <p>In the following lines, the poet has endeavoured to reproduce the
  impressions made upon his mind by the mountain scenery of the
  Caucasus; scenery which he had visited with such rapture, and to
  which his imagination returned with undiminished delight. It has been
  our aim to endeavour, in our translation, to give an echo, however
  feeble and imperfect, of the wild and airy <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> freedom
  of the versification which distinguishes these spirited stanzas. The
  picture which they contain, rough, sketchy, and unfinished, as it may
  appear, bears every mark of being a faithful copy from nature&#8212;a
  study taken on the spot; and will therefore, we trust, be not
  unacceptable to our readers, as calculated to give an idea not only
  of the vigorous and rapid <i>handling</i> of the poet&#39;s pencil,
  but also of the wild and sublime region&#8212;the Switzerland of
  Russia&#8212;which he has here essayed to portray. Of the two furious
  and picturesque torrents which PÃºshkin has mentioned in this short
  poem, TÃ©rek is certainly too well known to our geographical readers
  to need any description of its course from the snow-covered peak of
  DariÃ¡l to the Caspian; and the bold comparison in the last stanza
  will doubtless be found, though perhaps somewhat exaggerated, not
  deficient in a kind of fierce Ã†schylean energy, perfectly in
  character with the violent and thundering course of the torrent
  itself:&#8212;</p>

  <p>To those who measure the value of a poem, less by the pretension
  and ambitiousness of its form, than by the completeness of its

  naturalness and unity of the fundamental thought, and the happy

  <p>The versification of the following little poem is founded on a
  system which PÃºshkin seems to have looked upon with peculiar favour,
  as he has employed the same metrical arrangement in by far the
  largest proportion of his poetical works. So gracefully and so
  easily, indeed, has he wielded this metre, and with so flexible, so
  delicate, and so masterly a hand, that we could not refrain from
  attempting to imitate it in our English version; for we considered
  that it is impossible to say how much of the peculiar
  <i>character</i> of a poet&#39;s writings depends upon the colouring,
  or rather the <i>touch</i>&#8212;if we may borrow a phrase from the
  vocabulary of the critic in painting&#8212;of the metre. Undoubtedly
  a poet is the best judge not only of the kind, but of the degree of
  the effect which he wishes to produce upon his reader; and there may
  be, between the thoughts which he desires to embody, and the peculiar
  harmonies in which he may determine to clothe those thoughts,
  analogies and sympathies too delicate for our grosser ears; or, at
  least, if not too subtle and refined for our ears to perceive, yet
  far too delicate for us to define, or exactly to appreciate. Moved by
  this reasoning, we have always preferred to follow, as nearly as we
  could, the exact versification, and even the most minute varieties of
  tone and metrical accentuation. Inattention to this point is
  undoubtedly the stumbling-block of translators in general; of the
  dangerous consequences of such inattention, it is not necessary to
  give any elaborate proof. How much, we may ask, does not the poetry
  of Dante, for instance, lose, by being despoiled of that great source
  of its peculiar effect springing from the employment of the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg
  36]</a></span> <i>terza rima</i>! It is in vain to say, that it is
  enormously difficult to produce the <i>terza rima</i> in English. To
  translate the &quot;gran padre Alighier&quot; into English
  <i>worthily</i>, the <i>terza rima must</i> be employed, whatever be
  the obstacles presented by the dissimilarities existing between the
  Italian and English languages.</p>

  <p>The ballad entitled &quot;The Black Shawl&quot; has obtained a
  degree of popularity among the author&#39;s countrymen, for which the
  slightness of the composition renders it in some measure difficult to
  account. It may, perhaps, be explained by the circumstance, that the
  verses are in the original exceedingly well adapted to be
  sung&#8212;one of the highest merits of this class of
  poetry&#8212;for all ancient ballads, in every language throughout
  the world, were specifically intended to be sung or chanted; and all
  modern productions, therefore, written in imitation of these ancient
  compositions&#8212;the first lispings of the Muse&#8212;can only be
  successful in proportion as they possess the essential and
  characteristic quality of being capable of being sung. Independently
  of the highly musical arrangement of the rhythm, which, in the
  original, distinguishes &quot;The Black Shawl,&quot; the following
  verses cannot be denied the merit of relating, in a few rapid and
  energetic measures, a simple and striking story of Oriental love,
  vengeance, and remorse:&#8212;</p>

  <p>Among the thousand-and-one compositions, in all languages, founded
  upon the sublime theme of the downfall and death of Napoleon, there
  are, we think, very few which have surpassed, in weight of thought,
  in splendour of diction, and in grandeur of versification,
  PÃºshkin&#39;s noble lyric upon this subject. The mighty share which
  Russia had in overthrowing the gigantic power of the greatest of
  modern conquerors, could not fail of affording to a Russian poet a
  peculiar source of triumphant yet not too exulting inspiration; and
  PÃºshkin, in that portion of the following ode in which he is led more
  particularly to allude to the part played by his country in the
  sublime drama, whose catastrophe was the ruin of Bonaparte&#39;s
  blood-cemented empire, has given undeniable proof of his possessing
  that union of magnanimity and patriotism, which is not the meanest
  characteristic of elevated genius. While the poet gives full way to
  the triumphant feelings so naturally inspired by the exploits of
  Russian valour, and by the patient fortitude of Russian policy, he
  wisely and nobly abstains on indulging in any of those outbursts of
  gratified revenge and national hatred which deform the pages of
  almost all&#8212;poets, and even historians&#8212;who have written on
  this colossal subject.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id=

  <p>We now come to one of the most remarkable lyric productions of our
  Poet&#39;s genius, the &quot;General;&quot; and in order that our
  readers may be enabled to understand and appreciate this exquisite
  little poem, we shall preface it with a few remarks of an explanatory
  character; as the <i>details</i>, at least, of the events upon which
  it is founded may not be so generally known in England as they are in
  Russia. Our English readers, however, are doubtless sufficiently
  familiar with the history of the great campaign of the year 1812,
  which led to the burning of Moscow, and to the consequent
  annihilation of the mighty army which Napoleon led to perish in the
  snows of Russia, to remember one remarkable episode connected with
  that most important campaign. They remember that one of the Russian
  armies was placed under the command of Field-marshal Barclay de
  Tolly, a general descended from an ancient Scottish family which had
  been settled for some generations in Russia, but who was in every
  respect to be considered as a native Russian, being born a subject of
  the Tsar, and having, during a long life of service in the Russian
  army, gradually reached the highest military rank, and acquired a
  well-earned and universal reputation as an able strategist and a
  brave man. The mode of operations determined on at the beginning of
  this most momentous struggle, and persevered in throughout by the
  Russians, with a patience and steadiness no less admirable than the
  wisdom of the combinations on which they were founded, was a purely
  defensive system of tactics. The event amply demonstrated the
  soundness of the principles upon which those operations were based;
  for while Napoleon was gradually attracted into the interior of the
  country by armies which perpetually retired before him without giving
  him the opportunity of coming to a general action, the autumn was
  gradually passing away, and the flames of Moscow only served to light
  up, for the French army, the beginning of their hopeless retreat
  through a country now totally laid waste, and covered with the snows
  of a Russian winter. This mode of operations, however, was by no
  means likely to please the population of Russia, infuriated by the
  long unaccustomed presence of a hostile army within their sacred
  frontier, and worked up by all the circumstances of the invasion to
  the highest pitch of patriotic enthusiasm. Unable to appreciate the
  value of what must have appeared to them a timid and pusillanimous
  policy, they overwhelmed Barclay de Tolly with violent accusations of
  cowardice, and even of treachery; rendered the more plausible to the
  mind of the ignorant, by the circumstance of their object being a
  foreigner&#8212;or at least of foreign blood. So violent ultimately
  became these accusations, that although the Field-marshal continued
  to enjoy the highest confidence and esteem of his sovereign, it was
  found expedient to allow him to resign the chief command, in which he
  was succeeded by KutÃºzoff. Barclay de Tolly, during the greater part
  of the campaign, fought as a simple general of division, in which
  character (as PÃºshkin describes) he took part in the great battle of
  BorodÃ­no.</p>

  <p>Barclay must still be considered as one of those distinguished
  persons to whose memory justice has never been entirely done; and to
  do this justice was PÃºshkin&#39;s generous task in the noble lines
  which follow these remarks. No traveller has ever visited the winter
  palace of St Petersburg without <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> having been struck with the
  celebrated &quot;Hall of Marshals,&quot; which forms one of its most
  imposing features. In this magnificent room are placed the portraits
  (chiefly painted by Dawe, an English artist, who passed the greater
  part of his life in Russia) of the Russian generals who figured in
  that great campaign; and among them is to be found, of course, the
  &quot;counterfeit presentment&quot; of Barclay de Tolly, painted, as
  the field-marshals are in every case in this gallery of portraits, at
  full length. With respect to the versification of this and several
  other poems which we have selected, the English reader will not
  perhaps at first remark that it is nothing more than the measure used
  by old Drayton in the <i>Polyolbion</i>, and one in which a great
  deal of the earlier English poetry is written. It is very favourite
  measure of our Russian poet, who has, however, increased, in some
  degree, its difficulty for an English versifier, by introducing a
  great number of double terminations. It will be found, indeed, that
  these double rhymes are as numerous as the single or monosyllabic
  ones.</p>

  <h3>PART II.</h3>

  <p>The Oxford visions, of which some have been given, were but
  anticipations necessary to illustrate the glimpse opened of
  childhood, (as being its reaction.) In this <span class=
  'smcap'>Second</span> part, returning from that anticipation, I
  retrace an abstract of my boyish and youthful days so far as they
  furnished or exposed the germs of later experiences in worlds more
  shadowy.</p>

  <p>Upon me, as upon others scattered thinly by tens and twenties over
  every thousand years, fell too powerfully and too early the vision of
  life. The horror of life mixed itself already in earliest youth with
  the heavenly sweetness of life; that grief, which one in a hundred
  has sensibility enough to gather from the sad retrospect of life in
  its closing stage, for me shed its dews as a prelibation upon the
  fountains of life whilst yet sparkling to the morning sun. I saw from
  afar and from before what I was to see from behind. Is this the
  description of an early youth passed in the shades of gloom? No, but
  of a youth passed in the divinest happiness. And if the reader has
  (which so few have) the passion, without which there is no reading of
  the legend and superscription upon man&#39;s brow, if he is not (as
  most are) deafer than the grave to every <i>deep</i> note that sighs
  upwards from the Delphic caves of human life, he will know that the
  rapture of life (or any thing which by approach can merit that name)
  does not arise, unless as perfect music arises&#8212;music of Mozart
  or Beethoven&#8212;by the confluence of the mighty and terrific
  discords with the subtle concords. Not by contrast, or as reciprocal
  foils do these elements act, which is the feeble conception of many,
  but by union. They are the sexual forces in music: &quot;male and
  female created he them;&quot; and these mighty antagonists do not put
  forth their hostilities by repulsion, but by deepest attraction.</p>

  <p>As &quot;in to-day already walks to-morrow,&quot; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> so in the
  past experience of a youthful life may be seen dimly the future. The
  collisions with alien interests or hostile views, of a child, boy, or
  very young man, so insulated as each of these is sure to
  be,&#8212;those aspects of opposition which such a person <i>can</i>
  occupy, are limited by the exceedingly few and trivial lines of
  connexion along which he is able to radiate any essential influence
  whatever upon the fortunes or happiness of others. Circumstances may
  magnify his importance for the moment; but, after all, any cable
  which he carries out upon other vessels is easily slipped upon a feud
  arising. Far otherwise is the state of relations connecting an adult
  or responsible man with the circles around him as life advances. The
  network of these relations is a thousand times more intricate, the
  jarring of these intricate relations a thousand times more frequent,
  and the vibrations a thousand times harsher which these jarrings
  diffuse. This truth is felt beforehand misgivingly and in troubled
  vision, by a young man who stands upon the threshold of manhood. One
  earliest instinct of fear and horror would darken his spirit if it
  could be revealed to itself and self-questioned at the moment of
  birth: a second instinct of the sane nature would again pollute that
  tremulous mirror, if the moment were as punctually marked as physical
  birth is marked, which dismisses him finally upon the tides of
  absolute self-control. A dark ocean would seem the total expanse of
  life from the first: but far darker and more appalling would seem
  that interior and second chamber of the ocean which called him away
  for ever on the direct accountability of others. Dreadful would be
  the morning which should say&#8212;&quot;Be thou a human child
  incarnate;&quot; but more dreadful the morning which should
  say&#8212;&quot;Bear thou henceforth the sceptre of thy self-dominion
  through life, and the passion of life!&quot; Yes, dreadful would be
  both: but without a basis of the dreadful there is no perfect
  rapture. It is a part through the sorrow of life, growing out of its
  events, that this basis of awe and solemn darkness slowly
  accumulates. <i>That</i> I have illustrated. But, as life expands, it
  is more through the <i>strife</i> which besets us, strife from
  conflicting opinions, positions, passions, interests, that the
  funereal ground settles and deposits itself, which sends upward the
  dark lustrous brilliancy through the jewel of life&#8212;else
  revealing a pale and superficial glitter. Either the human being must
  suffer and struggle as the price of a more searching vision, or his
  gaze must be shallow and without intellectual revelation.</p>

  <p>Through accident it was in part, and, where through no accident
  but my own nature, not through features of it at all painful to
  recollect, that constantly in early life (that is, from boyish days
  until eighteen, when by going to Oxford, practically I became my own
  master) I was engaged in duels of fierce continual struggle, with
  some person or body of persons, that sought, like the Roman
  <i>retiarius</i>, to throw a net of deadly coercion or constraint
  over the undoubted rights of my natural freedom. The steady rebellion
  upon my part in one-half, was a mere human reaction of justifiable
  indignation; but in the other half it was the struggle of a
  conscientious nature&#8212;disdaining to feel it as any mere right or
  discretional privilege&#8212;no, feeling it as the noblest of duties
  to resist, though it should be mortally, those that would have
  enslaved me, and to retort scorn upon those that would have put my
  head below their feet. Too much, even in later life, I have perceived
  in men that pass for good men, a disposition to degrade (and if
  possible to degrade through self-degradation) those in whom
  unwillingly they feel any weight of oppression to themselves, by
  commanding qualities of intellect or character. They respect you:
  they are compelled to do so: and they hate to do so. Next, therefore,
  they seek to throw off the sense of this oppression, and to take
  vengeance for it, by co-operating with any unhappy accidents in your
  life, to inflict a sense of humiliation upon you, and (if possible)
  to force you into becoming a consenting party to that humiliation.
  Oh, wherefore is it that those who presume to call themselves the
  &quot;friends&quot; of this man or that woman, are so often those
  above all others, whom <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id=
  "Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> in the hour of death that man or woman
  is most likely to salute with the valediction&#8212;Would God I had
  never seen your face?</p>

  <p>In citing one or two cases of these early struggles, I have
  chiefly in view the effect of these upon my subsequent visions under
  the reign of opium. And this indulgent reflection should accompany
  the mature reader through all such records of boyish inexperience. A
  good tempered-man, who is also acquainted with the world, will easily
  evade, without needing any artifice of servile obsequiousness, those
  quarrels which an upright simplicity, jealous of its own rights, and
  unpractised in the science of worldly address, cannot always evade
  without some loss of self-respect. Suavity in this manner may, it is
  true, be reconciled with firmness in the matter; but not easily by a
  young person who wants all the appropriate resources of knowledge, of
  adroit and guarded language, for making his good temper available.
  Men are protected from insult and wrong, not merely by their own
  skill, but also in the absence of any skill at all, by the general
  spirit of forbearance to which society has trained all those whom
  they are likely to meet. But boys meeting with no such forbearance or
  training in other boys, must sometimes be thrown upon feuds in the
  ratio of their own firmness, much more than in the ratio of any
  natural proneness to quarrel. Such a subject, however, will be best
  illustrated by a sketch or two of my own principal feuds.</p>

  <p>The first, but merely transient and playful, nor worth noticing at
  all, but for its subsequent resurrection under other and awful
  colouring in my dreams, grew out of an imaginary slight, as I viewed
  it, put upon me by one of my guardians. I had four guardians: and the
  one of these who had the most knowledge and talent of the whole, a
  banker, living about a hundred miles from my home, had invited me
  when eleven years old to his house. His eldest daughter, perhaps a
  year younger than myself, wore at that time upon her very lovely face
  the most angelic expression of character and temper that I have
  almost ever seen. Naturally, I fell in love with her. It seems absurd
  to say so; and the more so, because two children more absolutely
  innocent than we were cannot be imagined, neither of us having ever
  been at any school;&#8212;but the simple truth is, that in the most
  chivalrous sense I was in love with her. And the proof that I was so
  showed itself in three separate modes: I kissed her glove on any rare
  occasion when I found it lying on a table; secondly, I looked out for
  some excuse to be jealous of her; and, thirdly, I did my very best to
  get up a quarrel. What I wanted the quarrel for was the luxury of a
  reconciliation; a hill cannot be had, you know, without going to the
  expense of a valley. And though I hated the very thought of a
  moment&#39;s difference with so truly gentle a girl, yet how, but
  through such a purgatory, could one win the paradise of her returning
  smiles? All this, however, came to nothing; and simply because she
  positively would <i>not</i> quarrel. And the jealousy fell through,
  because there was no decent subject for such a passion, unless it had
  settled upon an old music-master whom lunacy itself could not adopt
  as a rival. The quarrel meantime, which never prospered with the
  daughter, silently kindled on my part towards the father. His offence
  was this. At dinner, I naturally placed myself by the side of M., and
  it gave me great pleasure to touch her hand at intervals. As M. was
  my cousin, though twice or even three times removed, I did not feel
  taking too great a liberty in this little act of tenderness. No
  matter if three thousand times removed, I said, my cousin is my
  cousin: nor had I ever very much designed to conceal the act; or if
  so, rather on her account than my own. One evening, however, papa
  observed my man&#339;uvre. Did he seem displeased? Not at all: he
  even condescended to smile. But the next day he placed M. on the side
  opposite to myself. In one respect this was really an improvement;
  because it gave me a better view of my cousin&#39;s sweet
  countenance. But then there was the loss of the hand to be
  considered, and secondly there was the affront. It was clear that
  vengeance must be had. Now there was but one thing in this world that
  I could do even <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id=
  "Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> decently: but <i>that</i> I could do
  admirably. This was writing Latin hexameters. Juvenal, though it was
  not very much of him that I had then read, seemed to me a divine
  model. The inspiration of wrath spoke through him as through a Hebrew
  prophet. The same inspiration spoke now in me. <i>Facit indignatio
  versum</i>, said Juvenal. And it must be owned that Indignation has
  never made such good verses since as she did in that day. But still,
  even to me this agile passion proved a Muse of genial inspiration for
  a couple of paragraphs: and one line I will mention as worthy to have
  taken its place in Juvenal himself. I say this without scruple,
  having not a shadow of vanity, nor on the other hand a shadow of
  false modesty connected with such boyish accomplishments. The poem
  opened thus&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Te nimis austerum; sacrÃ¦ qui f&#339;dera
      mensÃ¦</span><br />
      <span class="i2">Diruis, insector SatyrÃ¦ reboante
      flagello.&quot;</span><br />
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But the line, which I insist upon as of Roman strength, was the
  closing one of the next sentence. The general effect of the sentiment
  was&#8212;that my clamorous wrath should make its way even into ears
  that were past hearing:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i8"><span style=
      "margin-left: 7em;">&quot;&#8212;&#8212;mea sÃ¦va
      querela</span><br />
      <span class="i2">Auribus insidet ceratis, auribus
      etsi</span><br />
      <span class="i2">Non audituris hybernÃ¢ nocte
      procellam.&quot;</span><br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The power, however, which inflated my verse, soon collapsed;
  having been soothed from the very first by finding&#8212;that except
  in this one instance at the dinner-table, which probably had been
  viewed as an indecorum, no further restraint of any kind whatever was
  meditated upon my intercourse with M. Besides, it was too painful to
  lock up good verses in one&#39;s own solitary breast. Yet how could I
  shock the sweet filial heart of my cousin by a fierce lampoon or
  <i>stylites</i> against her father, had Latin even figured amongst
  her accomplishments? Then it occurred to me that the verses might be
  shown to the father. But was there not something treacherous in
  gaining a man&#39;s approbation under a mask to a satire upon
  himself? Or would he have always understood me? For one person a year
  after took the <i>sacrÃ¦ mensÃ¦</i> (by which I had meant the
  sanctities of hospitality) to mean the sacramental table. And on
  consideration I began to suspect, that many people would pronounce
  myself the party who had violated the holy ties of hospitality, which
  are equally binding on guest as on host. Indolence, which sometimes
  comes in aid of good impulses as well as bad, favoured these
  relenting thoughts; the society of M. did still more to wean me from
  further efforts of satire: and, finally, my Latin poem remained a
  <i>torso</i>. But upon the whole my guardian had a narrow escape of
  descending to posterity in a disadvantageous light, had he rolled
  down to it through my hexameters.</p>

  <p>Here was a case of merely playful feud. But the same talent of
  Latin verses soon after connected me with a real feud that harassed
  my mind more than would be supposed, and precisely by this agency,
  viz. that it arrayed one set of feelings against another. It divided
  my mind as by domestic feud against itself. About a year after,
  returning from the visit to my guardian&#39;s, and when I must have
  been nearly completing my twelfth year, I was sent to a great public
  school. Every man has reason to rejoice who enjoys so great an
  advantage. I condemned and <i>do</i> condemn the practice of
  sometimes sending out into such stormy exposures those who are as yet
  too young, too dependent on female gentleness, and endowed with
  sensibilities too exquisite. But at nine or ten the masculine
  energies of the character are beginning to be developed: or, if not,
  no discipline will better aid in their developement than the bracing
  intercourse of a great English classical school. Even the selfish are
  forced into accommodating themselves to a public standard of
  generosity, and the effeminate into conforming to a rule of
  manliness. I was myself at two public schools; and I think with
  gratitude of the benefit which I reaped from both; as also I think
  with gratitude of the upright guardian in whose quiet household I
  learned Latin so effectually. But the small private schools which I
  witnessed for brief periods, containing <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> thirty to
  forty boys, were models of ignoble manners as respected some part of
  the juniors, and of favouritism amongst the masters. Nowhere is the
  sublimity of public justice so broadly exemplified as in an English
  school. There is not in the universe such an areopagus for fair play
  and abhorrence of all crooked ways, as an English mob, or one of the
  English time-honoured public schools. But my own first introduction
  to such an establishment was under peculiar and contradictory
  circumstances. When my &quot;rating,&quot; or graduation in the
  school, was to be settled, naturally my altitude (to speak
  astronomically) was taken by the proficiency in Greek. But I could
  then barely construe books so easy as the Greek Testament and the
  Iliad. This was considered quite well enough for my age; but still it
  caused me to be placed three steps below the highest rank in the
  school. Within one week, however, my talent for Latin verses, which
  had by this time gathered strength and expansion, became known. I was
  honoured as never was man or boy since Mordecai the Jew. Not properly
  belonging to the flock of the head master, but to the leading section
  of the second, I was now weekly paraded for distinction at the
  supreme tribunal of the school; out of which at first grew nothing
  but a sunshine of approbation delightful to my heart, still brooding
  upon solitude. Within six weeks this had changed. The approbation
  indeed continued, and the public testimony of it. Neither would
  there, in the ordinary course, have been any painful reaction from
  jealousy or fretful resistance to the soundness of my pretensions;
  since it was sufficiently known to some of my schoolfellows, that I,
  who had no male relatives but military men, and those in India, could
  not have benefited by any clandestine aid. But, unhappily, the head
  master was at that time dissatisfied with some points in the progress
  of his head form; and, as it soon appeared, was continually throwing
  in their teeth the brilliancy of my verses at twelve, by comparison
  with theirs at seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen. I had observed him
  sometimes pointing to myself; and was perplexed at seeing the gesture
  followed by gloomy looks, and what French reporters call
  &quot;sensation,&quot; in these young men, whom naturally I viewed
  with awe as my leaders, boys that were called young men, men that
  were reading Sophocles&#8212;(a name that carried with it the sound
  of something seraphic to my ears)&#8212;and who never had vouchsafed
  to waste a word on such a child as myself. The day was come, however,
  when all that would be changed. One of these leaders strode up to me
  in the public playgrounds, and delivering a blow on my shoulder,
  which was not intended to hurt me, but as a mere formula of
  introduction, asked me, &quot;What the d&#8212;l I meant by bolting
  out of the course, and annoying other people in that manner? Were
  other people to have no rest for me and my verses, which, after all,
  were horribly bad?&quot; There might have been some difficulty in
  returning an answer to this address, but none was required. I was
  briefly admonished to see that I wrote worse for the future, or
  else&#8212;&#8212;At this <i>aposiopesis</i> I looked enquiringly at
  the speaker, and he filled up the chasm by saying, that he would
  &quot;annihilate&quot; me. Could any person fail to be aghast at such
  a demand? I was to write worse than my own standard, which, by his
  account of my verses, must be difficult; and I was to write worse
  than himself, which might be impossible. My feelings revolted, it may
  be supposed, against so arrogant a demand, unless it had been far
  otherwise expressed; and on the next occasion for sending up verses,
  so far from attending to the orders issued, I double-shotted my guns;
  double applause descended on myself; but I remarked with some awe,
  though not repenting of what I had done, that double confusion seemed
  to agitate the ranks of my enemies. Amongst them loomed out in the
  distance my &quot;annihilating&quot; friend, who shook his huge fist
  at me, but with something like a grim smile about his eyes. He took
  an early opportunity of paying his respects to me&#8212;saying,
  &quot;You little devil, do you call this writing your worst?&quot;
  &quot;No,&quot; I replied; &quot;I call it writing my best.&quot; The
  annihilator, as it turned out, was really a good-natured young man;
  but he soon went off to Cambridge; and with <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> the rest,
  or some of them, I continued to wage war for nearly a year. And yet,
  for a word spoken with kindness, I would have resigned the
  peacock&#39;s feather in my cap as the merest of baubles.
  Undoubtedly, praise sounded sweet in my ears also. But <i>that</i>
  was nothing by comparison with what stood on the other side. I
  detested distinctions that were connected with mortification to
  others. And, even if I could have got over <i>that</i>, the eternal
  feud fretted and tormented my nature. Love, that once in childhood
  had been so mere a necessity to me, <i>that</i> had long been a mere
  reflected ray from a departed sunset. But peace, and freedom from
  strife, if love were no longer possible, (as so rarely it is in this
  world,) was the absolute necessity of my heart. To contend with
  somebody was still my fate; how to escape the contention I could not
  see; and yet for itself, and the deadly passions into which it forced
  me, I hated and loathed it more than death. It added to the
  distraction and internal feud of my own mind&#8212;that I could not
  <i>altogether</i> condemn the upper boys. I was made a handle of
  humiliation to them. And in the mean time, if I had an advantage in
  one accomplishment, which is all a matter of accident, or peculiar
  taste and feeling, they, on the other hand, had a great advantage
  over me in the more elaborate difficulties of Greek, and of choral
  Greek poetry. I could not altogether wonder at their hatred of
  myself. Yet still, as they had chosen to adopt this mode of conflict
  with me, I did not feel that I had any choice but to resist. The
  contest was terminated for me by my removal from the school, in
  consequence of a very threatening illness affecting my head; but it
  lasted nearly a year; and it did not close before several amongst my
  public enemies had become my private friends. They were much older,
  but they invited me to the houses of their friends, and showed me a
  respect which deeply affected me&#8212;this respect having more
  reference, apparently, to the firmness I had exhibited than to the
  splendour of my verses. And, indeed, these had rather drooped from a
  natural accident; several persons of my own class had formed the
  practice of asking me to write verses for <i>them</i>. I could not
  refuse. But, as the subjects given out were the same for all of us,
  it was not possible to take so many crops off the ground without
  starving the quality of all.</p>

  <p>Two years and a half from this time, I was again at a public
  school of ancient foundation. Now I was myself one of the three who
  formed the highest class. Now I myself was familiar with Sophocles,
  who once had been so shadowy a name in my ear. But, strange to say,
  now in my sixteenth year, I cared nothing at all for the glory of
  Latin verse. All the business of school was slight and trivial in my
  eyes. Costing me not an effort, it could not engage any part of my
  attention; that was now swallowed up altogether by the literature of
  my native land. I still reverenced the Grecian drama, as always I
  must. But else I cared little then for classical pursuits. A deeper
  spell had mastered me; and I lived only in those bowers where deeper
  passions spoke.</p>

  <p>Here, however, it was that began another and more important
  struggle. I was drawing near to seventeen, and, in a year after
  <i>that</i>, would arrive the usual time for going to Oxford. To
  Oxford my guardians made no objection; and they readily agreed to
  make the allowance then universally regarded as the <i>minimum</i>
  for an Oxford student, viz. Â£200 per annum. But they insisted, as a
  previous condition, that I should make a positive and definitive
  choice of a profession. Now I was well aware that, if I <i>did</i>
  make such a choice, no law existed, nor could any obligation be
  created through deeds or signature, by which I could finally be
  compelled into keeping my engagement. But this evasion did not suit
  me. Here, again, I felt indignantly that the principle of the attempt
  was unjust. The object was certainly to do me service by saving
  money, since, if I selected the bar as my profession, it was
  contended by some persons, (misinformed, however,) that not Oxford,
  but a special pleader&#39;s office, would be my proper destination;
  but I cared not for arguments of that sort. Oxford I was determined
  to make my home; and also to bear my future course utterly
  untrammeled by promises that I might repent. Soon came <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> the
  catastrophe of this struggle. A little before my seventeenth
  birthday, I walked off one lovely summer morning to North
  Wales&#8212;rambled there for months&#8212;and, finally, under some
  obscure hopes of raising money on my personal security, I went up to
  London. Now I was in my eighteenth year; and, during this period it
  was that I passed through that trial of severe distress, of which I
  gave some account in my former Confessions. Having a motive, however,
  for glancing backwards briefly at that period in the present series,
  I will do so at this point.</p>

  <p>I saw in one journal an insinuation that the incidents in the
  <i>preliminary</i> narrative were possibly without foundation. To
  such an expression of mere gratuitous malignity, as it happened to be
  supported by no one argument except a remark, apparently absurd, but
  certainly false, I did not condescend to answer. In reality, the
  possibility had never occurred to me that any person of judgment
  would seriously suspect me of taking liberties with that part of the
  work, since, though no one of the parties concerned but myself stood
  in so central a position to the circumstances as to be acquainted
  with <i>all</i> of them, many were acquainted with each separate
  section of the memoir. Relays of witnesses might have been summoned
  to mount guard, as it were, upon the accuracy of each particular in
  the whole succession of incidents; and some of these people had an
  interest, more or less strong, in exposing any deviation from the
  strictest <i>letter</i> of the truth, had it been in their power to
  do so. It is now twenty-two years since I saw the objection here
  alluded to; and, in saying that I did not condescend to notice it,
  the reader must not find any reason for taxing me with a blamable
  haughtiness. But every man is entitled to be haughty when his
  veracity is impeached; and, still more, when it is impeached by a
  dishonest objection, or, if not <i>that</i>, by an objection which
  argues a carelessness of attention almost amounting to dishonesty, in
  a case where it was meant to sustain an imputation of falsehood. Let
  a man read carelessly if he will, but not where he is meaning to use
  his reading for a purpose of wounding another man&#39;s honour.
  Having thus, by twenty-two years&#39; silence, sufficiently expressed
  my contempt for the slander,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id=
  "FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class=
  "fnanchor">[19]</a> I now feel myself at liberty to draw it into
  notice, for the sake, <i>inter alia</i>, of showing in how rash a
  spirit malignity often works. In the preliminary account of certain
  boyish adventures which had exposed me to suffering of a kind not
  commonly incident to persons in my station of life, and leaving
  behind a temptation to the use of opium under certain arrears of
  weakness, I had occasion to notice a disreputable attorney in London,
  who showed me some attentions, partly on my own account as a boy of
  some expectations, but much more with the purpose of fastening his
  professional grappling-hooks upon the young Earl of A&#8212;&#8212;t,
  my former companion, and my present correspondent. This man&#39;s
  house was slightly described, and, with more minuteness, I had
  exposed some interesting traits in his household economy. A question,
  therefore, naturally arose in several people&#39;s
  curiosity&#8212;Where was this house situated? and the more so
  because I had pointed a renewed attention to it by saying, that on
  that very evening, (viz. the evening on which that particular page of
  the Confessions was written,) I had visited the street, looked up at
  the windows, and, instead of the gloomy desolation reigning there
  when myself and a little girl were the sole nightly tenants, sleeping
  in fact <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg
  50]</a></span> (poor freezing creatures that we both were) on the
  floor of the attorney&#39;s law-chamber, and making a pillow out of
  his infernal parchments, I had seen with pleasure the evidences of
  comfort, respectability, and domestic animation, in the lights and
  stir prevailing through different stories of the house. Upon this the
  upright critic told his readers that I had described the house as
  standing in Oxford Street, and then appealed to their own knowledge
  of that street whether such a house could be <i>so</i> situated. Why
  not&#8212;he neglected to tell us. The houses at the east end of
  Oxford Street are certainly of too small an order to meet my account
  of the attorney&#39;s house; but why should it be at the east end?
  Oxford Street is a mile and a quarter long, and being built
  continuously on both sides, finds room for houses of <i>many</i>
  classes. Meantime it happens that, although the true house was most
  obscurely indicated, <i>any</i> house whatever in Oxford Street was
  most luminously excluded. In all the immensity of London there was
  but one single street that could be challenged by an attentive reader
  of the Confessions as peremptorily <i>not</i> the street of the
  attorney&#39;s house&#8212;and <i>that</i> one was Oxford Street;
  for, in speaking of my own renewed acquaintance with the outside of
  this house, I used some expression implying that, in order to make
  such a visit of reconnoissance, I had turned <i>aside</i> from Oxford
  Street. The matter is a perfect trifle in itself, but it is no trifle
  in a question affecting a writer&#39;s accuracy. If in a thing so
  absolutely impossible to be forgotten as the true situation of a
  house painfully memorable to a man&#39;s feelings, from being the
  scene of boyish distresses the most exquisite&#8212;nights passed in
  the misery of cold, and hunger preying upon him both night and day,
  in a degree which very many would not have survived,&#8212;he, when
  retracing his schoolboy annals, could have shown indecision even, far
  more dreaded inaccuracy, in identifying the house, not one syllable
  after <i>that</i>, which he could have said on any other subject,
  would have won any confidence, or deserved any, from a judicious
  reader. I may now mention&#8212;the Herod being dead whose
  persecutions I had reason to fear&#8212;that the house in question
  stands in Greek Street on the west, and is the house on that side
  nearest to Soho-Square, but without looking into the Square. This it
  was hardly safe to mention at the date of the published Confessions.
  It was my private opinion, indeed, that there were probably
  twenty-five chances to one in favour of my friend the attorney having
  been by that time hanged. But then this argued inversely; one chance
  to twenty-five that my friend might be <i>un</i>hanged, and knocking
  about the streets of London; in which case it would have been a
  perfect god-send to him that here lay an opening (of <i>my</i>
  contrivance, not <i>his</i>) for requesting the opinion of a jury on
  the amount of <i>solatium</i> due to his wounded feelings in an
  action on the passage in the Confessions. To have indicated even the
  street would have been enough. Because there could surely be but one
  such Grecian in Greek Street, or but one that realized the other
  conditions of the unknown quantity. There was also a separate danger
  not absolutely so laughable as it sounds. Me there was little chance
  that the attorney should meet; but my book he might easily have met
  (supposing always that the warrant of <i>Sus. per coll.</i> had not
  yet on <i>his</i> account travelled down to Newgate.) For he was
  literary; admired literature; and, as a lawyer, he wrote on some
  subjects fluently; Might he not publish <i>his</i> Confessions? Or,
  which would be worse, a supplement to mine&#8212;printed so as
  exactly to match? In which case I should have had the same affliction
  that Gibbon the historian dreaded so much; viz. that of seeing a
  refutation of himself, and his own answer to the refutation, all
  bound up in one and the same self-combating volume. Besides, he would
  have cross-examined me before the public in Old Bailey style; no
  story, the most straightforward that ever was told, could be sure to
  stand <i>that</i>. And my readers might be left in a state of painful
  doubt whether <i>he</i> might not, after all, have been a model of
  suffering innocence&#8212;I (to say the kindest thing possible)
  plagued with the natural treacheries of a schoolboy&#39;s memory. In
  taking leave of this case and the remembrances connected with it, let
  me say that, although really believing in the probability
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg
  51]</a></span> of the attorney&#39;s having at least found his way to
  Australia, I had no satisfaction in thinking of that result. I knew
  my friend to be the very perfection of a scamp. And in the running
  account between us, (I mean, in the ordinary sense, as to money,) the
  balance could not be in <i>his</i> favour; since I, on receiving a
  sum of money, (considerable in the eyes of us both,) had transferred
  pretty nearly the whole of it to <i>him</i>, for the purpose
  ostensibly held out to me (but of course a hoax) of purchasing
  certain law &quot;stamps;&quot; for he was then pursuing a diplomatic
  correspondence with various Jews who lent money to young heirs, in
  some trifling proportion on my own insignificant account, but much
  more truly on the account of Lord A&#8212;&#8212;t, my young friend.
  On the other side, he had given to me simply the reliques of his
  breakfast-table, which itself was hardly more than a relique. But in
  this he was not to blame. He could not give to me what he had not for
  himself, nor sometimes for the poor starving child whom I now suppose
  to have been his illegitimate daughter. So desperate was the running
  fight, yard-arm to yard-arm, which he maintained with creditors
  fierce as famine and hungry as the grave; so deep also was his horror
  (I know not for which of the various reasons supposable) against
  falling into a prison, that he seldom ventured to sleep twice
  successively in the same house. That expense of itself must have
  pressed heavily in London, where you pay half-a-crown at least for a
  bed that would cost only a shilling in the provinces. In the midst of
  his knaveries, and what were even more shocking to my remembrance,
  his confidential discoveries in his rambling conversations of knavish
  <i>designs</i>, (not always pecuniary,) there was a light of
  wandering misery in his eye at times, which affected me afterwards at
  intervals when I recalled it in the radiant happiness of nineteen,
  and amidst the solemn tranquillities of Oxford. That of itself was
  interesting; the man was worse by far than he had been meant to be;
  he had not the mind that reconciles itself to evil. Besides, he
  respected scholarship, which appeared by the deference he generally
  showed to myself, then about seventeen; he had an interest in
  literature; <i>that</i> argues something good; and was pleased at any
  time, or even cheerful, when I turned the conversation upon books;
  nay, he seemed touched with emotion, when I quoted some sentiment
  noble and impassioned from one of the great poets, and would ask me
  to repeat it. He would have been a man of memorable energy, and for
  good purposes, had it not been for his agony of conflict with
  pecuniary embarrassments. These probably had commenced in some fatal
  compliance with temptation arising out of funds confided to him by a
  client. Perhaps he had gained fifty guineas for a moment of
  necessity, and had sacrificed for that trifle <i>only</i> the
  serenity and the comfort of a life. Feelings of relenting kindness,
  it was not in my nature to refuse in such a case; and I wished to * *
  * But I never succeeded in tracing his steps through the wilderness
  of London until some years back, when I ascertained that he was dead.
  Generally speaking, the few people whom I have disliked in this world
  were flourishing people of good repute. Whereas the knaves whom I
  have known, one and all, and by no means few, I think of with
  pleasure and kindness.</p>

  <p>Heavens! when I look back to the sufferings which I have witnessed
  or heard of even from this one brief London experience, I say if life
  could throw open its long suits of chambers to our eyes from some
  station <i>beforehand</i>, if from some secret stand we could look
  <i>by anticipation</i> along its vast corridors, and aside into the
  recesses opening upon them from either hand, halls of tragedy or
  chambers of retribution, simply in that small wing and no more of the
  great caravanserai which we ourselves shall haunt, simply in that
  narrow tract of time and no more where we ourselves shall range, and
  confining our gaze to those and no others for whom personally we
  shall be interested, what a recoil we should suffer of horror in our
  estimate of life! What if those sudden catastrophes, or those
  inexpiable afflictions, which <i>have</i> already descended upon the
  people within my <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id=
  "Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> own knowledge, and almost below my own
  eyes, all of them now gone past, and some long past, had been thrown
  open before me as a secret exhibition when first I and they stood
  within the vestibule of morning hopes; when the calamities themselves
  had hardly begun to gather in their elements of possibility, and when
  some of the parties to them were as yet no more than infants! The
  past viewed not <i>as</i> the past, but by a spectator who steps back
  ten years deeper into the rear, in order that he may regard it as a
  future; the calamity of 1840 contemplated from the station of
  1830&#8212;the doom that rang the knell of happiness viewed from a
  point of time when as yet it was neither feared nor would even have
  been intelligible&#8212;the name that killed in 1843, which in 1835
  would have struck no vibration upon the heart&#8212;the portrait that
  on the day of her Majesty&#39;s coronation would have been admired by
  you with a pure disinterested admiration, but which if seen to-day
  would draw forth an involuntary groan&#8212;cases such as these are
  strangely moving for all who add deep thoughtfulness to deep
  sensibility. As the hastiest of improvisations, accept&#8212;fair
  reader, (for you it is that will chiefly feel such an invocation of
  the past)&#8212;three or four illustrations from my own
  experience.</p>

  <p>Who is this distinguished-looking young woman with her eyes
  drooping, and the shadow of a dreadful shock yet fresh upon every
  feature? Who is the elderly lady with her eyes flashing fire? Who is
  the downcast child of sixteen? What is that torn paper lying at their
  feet? Who is the writer? Whom does the paper concern? Ah! if she, if
  the central figure in the group&#8212;twenty-two at the moment when
  she is revealed to us&#8212;could, on her happy birth-day at sweet
  seventeen, have seen the image of herself five years onwards, just as
  <i>we</i> see it now, would she have prayed for life as for an
  absolute blessing? or would she not have prayed to be taken from the
  evil to come&#8212;to be taken away one evening at least before this
  day&#39;s sun arose? It is true, she still wears a look of gentle
  pride, and a relic of that noble smile which belongs to <i>her</i>
  that suffers an injury which many times over she would have died
  sooner than inflict. Womanly pride refuses itself before witnesses to
  the total prostration of the blow; but, for all <i>that</i>, you may
  see that she longs to be left alone, and that her tears will flow
  without restraint when she is so. This room is her pretty boudoir, in
  which, till to-night&#8212;poor thing!&#8212;she has been glad and
  happy. There stands her miniature conservatory, and there expands her
  miniature library; as we circumnavigators of literature are apt (you
  know) to regard all female libraries in the light of miniatures. None
  of these will ever rekindle a smile on <i>her</i> face; and there,
  beyond, is her music, which only of all that she possesses, will now
  become dearer to her than ever; but not, as once, to feed a
  self-mocked pensiveness, or to cheat a half-visionary sadness. She
  will be sad indeed. But she is one of those that will suffer in
  silence. Nobody will ever detect <i>her</i> failing in any point of
  duty, or querulously seeking the support in others which she can find
  for herself in this solitary room. Droop she will not in the sight of
  men; and, for all beyond, nobody has any concern with <i>that</i>
  except God. You shall hear what becomes of her, before we take our
  departure; but now let me tell you what has happened. In the main
  outline I am sure you guess already without aid of mine, for we
  leaden-eyed men, in such cases, see nothing by comparison with you
  our quick-witted sisters. That haughty-looking lady with the Roman
  cast of features, who must once have been strikingly
  handsome&#8212;an Agrippina, even yet, in a favourable
  presentation&#8212;is the younger lady&#39;s aunt. She, it is
  rumoured, once sustained, in her younger days, some injury of that
  same cruel nature which has this day assailed her niece, and ever
  since she has worn an air of disdain, not altogether unsupported by
  real dignity, towards men. This aunt it was that tore the letter
  which lies upon the floor. It deserved to be torn; and yet she that
  had the best right to do so would <i>not</i> have torn it. That
  letter was an elaborate attempt on the part of an accomplished young
  man to release himself from sacred engagements. What need
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg
  53]</a></span> was there to argue the case of <i>such</i>
  engagements? Could it have been requisite with pure female dignity to
  plead any thing, or do more than <i>look</i> an indisposition to
  fulfil them? The aunt is now moving towards the door, which I am glad
  to see; and she is followed by that pale timid girl of sixteen, a
  cousin, who feels the case profoundly, but is too young and shy to
  offer an intellectual sympathy.</p>

  <p>One only person in this world there is, who <i>could</i> to-night
  have been a supporting friend to our young sufferer, and <i>that</i>
  is her dear loving twin-sister, that for eighteen years read and
  wrote, thought and sang, slept and breathed, with the dividing-door
  open for ever between their bedrooms, and never once a separation
  between their hearts; but she is in a far distant land. Who else is
  there at her call? Except God, nobody. Her aunt had somewhat sternly
  admonished her, though still with a relenting in her eye as she
  glanced aside at the expression in her niece&#39;s face, that she
  must &quot;call pride to her assistance.&quot; Ay, true; but pride,
  though a strong ally in public, is apt in private to turn as
  treacherous as the worst of those against whom she is invoked. How
  could it be dreamed by a person of sense, that a brilliant young man
  of merits, various and eminent, in spite of his baseness, to whom,
  for nearly two years, this young woman had given her whole confiding
  love, might be dismissed from a heart like hers on the earliest
  summons of pride, simply because she herself had been dismissed from
  <i>his</i>, or seemed to have been dismissed, on a summons of
  mercenary calculation? Look! now that she is relieved from the weight
  of an unconfidential presence, she has sat for two hours with her
  head buried in her hands. At last she rises to look for something. A
  thought has struck her; and, taking a little golden key which hangs
  by a chain within her bosom, she searches for something locked up
  amongst her few jewels. What is it? It is a Bible exquisitely
  illuminated, with a letter attached, by some pretty silken artifice,
  to the blank leaves at the end. This letter is a beautiful record,
  wisely and pathetically composed, of maternal anxiety still burning
  strong in death, and yearning, when all objects beside were fast
  fading from <i>her</i> eyes, after one parting act of communion with
  the twin darlings of her heart. Both were thirteen years old, within
  a week or two, as on the night before her death they sat weeping by
  the bedside of their mother, and hanging on her lips, now for
  farewell whispers, and now for farewell kisses. They both knew that,
  as her strength had permitted during the latter month of her life,
  she had thrown the last anguish of love in her beseeching heart into
  a letter of counsel to themselves. Through this, of which each sister
  had a copy, she trusted long to converse with her orphans. And the
  last promise which she had entreated on this evening from both,
  was&#8212;that in either of two contingencies they would review her
  counsels, and the passages to which she pointed their attention in
  the Scriptures; namely, first, in the event of any calamity, that,
  for one sister or for both, should overspread their paths with total
  darkness; and secondly, in the event of life flowing in too profound
  a stream of prosperity, so as to threaten them with an alienation of
  interest from all spiritual objects. She had not concealed that, of
  these two extreme cases, she would prefer for her own children the
  first. And now had that case arrived indeed, which she in spirit had
  desired to meet. Nine years ago, just as the silvery voice of a dial
  in the dying lady&#39;s bedroom was striking nine upon a summer
  evening, had the last visual ray streamed from her seeking eyes upon
  her orphan twins, after which, throughout the night, she had slept
  away into heaven. Now again had come a summer evening memorable for
  unhappiness; now again the daughter thought of those dying lights of
  love which streamed at sunset from the closing eyes of her mother;
  again, and just as she went back in thought to this image, the same
  silvery voice of the dial sounded nine o&#39;clock. Again she
  remembered her mother&#39;s dying request; again her own
  tear-hallowed promise&#8212;and with her heart in her mother&#39;s
  grave she now rose to fulfil it. Here, then when this solemn
  recurrence to a testamentary counsel has ceased to be a <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> mere
  office of duty towards the departed, having taken the shape of a
  consolation for herself, let us pause.</p>
  <hr style='width: 45%;' />

  <p>Now, fair companion in this exploring voyage of inquest into
  hidden scenes, or forgotten scenes of human life&#8212;perhaps it
  might be instructive to direct our glasses upon the false perfidious
  lover. It might. But do not let us do so. We might like him better,
  or pity him more, than either of us would desire. His name and memory
  have long since dropped out of every body&#39;s thoughts. Of
  prosperity, and (what is more important) of internal peace, he is
  reputed to have had no gleam from the moment when he betrayed his
  faith, and in one day threw away the jewel of good conscience, and
  &quot;a pearl richer than all his tribe.&quot; But, however that may
  be, it is certain that, finally, he became a wreck; and of any
  <i>hopeless</i> wreck it is painful to talk&#8212;much more so, when
  through him others also became wrecks.</p>

  <p>Shall we, then, after an interval of nearly two years has passed
  over the young lady in the boudoir, look in again upon <i>her</i>?
  You hesitate, fair friend: and I myself hesitate. For in fact she
  also has become a wreck; and it would grieve us both to see her
  altered. At the end of twenty-one months she retains hardly a vestige
  of resemblance to the fine young woman we saw on that unhappy evening
  with her aunt and cousin. On consideration, therefore, let us do
  this. We will direct our glasses to her room, at a point of time
  about six weeks further on. Suppose this time gone; suppose her now
  dressed for her grave, and placed in her coffin. The advantage of
  that is&#8212;that, though no change can restore the ravages of the
  past, yet (as often is found to happen with young persons) the
  expression has revived from her girlish years. The child-like aspect
  has revolved, and settled back upon her features. The wasting away of
  the flesh is less apparent in the face; and one might imagine that,
  in this sweet marble countenance, was seen the very same upon which,
  eleven years ago, her mother&#39;s darkening eyes had lingered to the
  last, until clouds had swallowed up the vision of her beloved
  <i>twins</i>. Yet, if that were in part a fancy, this at least is no
  fancy&#8212;that not only much of a child-like truth and simplicity
  has reinstated itself in the temple of her now reposing features, but
  also that tranquillity and perfect peace, such as are appropriate to
  eternity; but which from the <i>living</i> countenance had taken
  their flight for ever, on that memorable evening when we looked in
  upon the impassioned group&#8212;upon the towering and denouncing
  aunt, the sympathizing but silent cousin, the poor blighted niece,
  and the wicked letter lying in fragments at their feet.</p>

  <p>Cloud, that hast revealed to us this young creature and her
  blighted hopes, close up again. And now, a few years later, not more
  than four or five, give back to us the latest arrears of the changes
  which thou concealest within thy draperies. Once more, &quot;open
  sesame!&quot; and show us a third generation. Behold a lawn islanded
  with thickets. How perfect is the verdure&#8212;how rich the
  blossoming shrubberies that screen with verdurous walls from the
  possibility of intrusion, whilst by their own wandering line of
  distribution they shape and umbrageously embay, what one might call
  lawny saloons and vestibules&#8212;sylvan galleries and closets. Some
  of these recesses, which unlink themselves as fluently as snakes, and
  unexpectedly as the shyest nooks, watery cells, and crypts, amongst
  the shores of a forest-lake, being formed by the mere caprices and
  ramblings of the luxuriant shrubs, are so small and so quiet, that
  one might fancy them meant for <i>boudoirs</i>. Here is one that, in
  a less fickle climate, would make the loveliest of studies for a
  writer of breathings from some solitary heart, or of <i>suspiria</i>
  from some impassioned memory! And opening from one angle of this
  embowered study, issues a little narrow corridor, that, after almost
  wheeling back upon itself, in its playful mazes, finally widens into
  a little circular chamber; out of which there is no exit, (except
  back again by the entrance,) small or great; so that, adjacent to his
  study, the writer would command how sweet a bed-room, permitting him
  to lie the summer through, gazing all night long at the burning
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg
  55]</a></span> host of heaven. How silent <i>that</i> would be at the
  noon of summer nights, how grave-like in its quiet! And yet, need
  there be asked a stillness or a silence more profound than is felt at
  this present noon of day? One reason for such peculiar repose, over
  and above the tranquil character of the day, and the distance of the
  place from high-roads, is the outer zone of woods, which almost on
  every quarter invests the shrubberies&#8212;swathing them, (as one
  may express it,) belting them, and overlooking them, from a varying
  distance of two and three furlongs, so as oftentimes to keep the
  winds at a distance. But, however caused and supported, the silence
  of these fanciful lawns and lawny chambers is oftentimes oppressive
  in the depth of summer to people unfamiliar with solitudes, either
  mountainous or sylvan; and many would be apt to suppose that the
  villa, to which these pretty shrubberies form the chief dependencies,
  must be untenanted. But that is not the case. The house is inhabited,
  and by its own legal mistress&#8212;the proprietress of the whole
  domain; and not at all a silent mistress, but as noisy as most little
  ladies of five years old, for that is her age. Now, and just as we
  are speaking, you may hear her little joyous clamour as she issues
  from the house. This way she comes, bounding like a fawn; and soon
  she rushes into the little recess which I pointed out as a proper
  study for any man who should be weaving the deep harmonies of
  memorial <i>suspiria</i>. But I fancy that she will soon dispossess
  it of that character, for her <i>suspiria</i> are not many at this
  stage of her life. Now she comes dancing into sight; and you see
  that, if she keeps the promise of her infancy, she will be an
  interesting creature to the eye in after life. In other respects,
  also, she is an engaging child&#8212;loving, natural, and wild as any
  one of her neighbours for some miles round; viz. leverets, squirrels
  and ring-doves. But what will surprise you most is&#8212;that,
  although a child of pure English blood, she speaks very little
  English; but more Bengalee than perhaps you will find it convenient
  to construe. That is her Ayah, who comes up from behind at a pace so
  different from her youthful mistress&#39;s. But, if their paces are
  different, in other things they agree most cordially; and dearly they
  love each other. In reality, the child has passed her whole life in
  the arms of this ayah. She remembers nothing elder than <i>her</i>;
  eldest of things is the ayah in her eyes; and, if the ayah should
  insist on her worshipping herself as the goddess Railroadina or
  Steamboatina, that made England and the sea and Bengal, it is certain
  that the little thing would do so, asking no question but
  this&#8212;whether kissing would do for worshipping.</p>

  <p>Every evening at nine o&#39;clock, as the ayah sits by the little
  creature lying awake in bed, the silvery tongue of a dial tolls the
  hour. Reader, you know who she is. She is the granddaughter of her
  that faded away about sunset in gazing at her twin orphans. Her name
  is Grace. And she is the niece of that elder and once happy Grace,
  who spent so much of her happiness in this very room, but whom, in
  her utter desolation, we saw in the boudoir with the torn letter at
  her feet. She is the daughter of that other sister, wife to a
  military officer, who died abroad. Little Grace never saw her
  grandmama, nor her lovely aunt that was her namesake, nor consciously
  her mama. She was born six months after the death of the elder Grace;
  and her mother saw her only through the mists of mortal suffering,
  which carried her off three weeks after the birth of her
  daughter.</p>

  <p>This view was taken several years ago; and since then the younger
  Grace in her turn is under a cloud of affliction. But she is still
  under eighteen; and of her there may be hopes. Seeing such things in
  so short a space of years, for the grandmother died at thirty-two, we
  say&#8212;Death we can face: but knowing, as some of us do, what is
  human life, which of us is it that without shuddering could (if
  consciously we were summoned) face the hour of birth?</p>

  <h2><a name="NORTHERN_LIGHTS" id="NORTHERN_LIGHTS"></a>NORTHERN
  LIGHTS.</h2>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;It was on a bright July morning that I found myself whirled
    away by railroad from Berlin, &#39;that great ostrich egg in the
    sand,&#39; which the sun of civilization is said to have
    hatched.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>In these words, and with this somewhat far-fetched simile, does a
  German tourist, Edward Boas by name, commence his narrative of a
  recent pilgrimage to the far north. Undeterred by the disadvantageous
  accounts given of those regions by a traveller who had shortly before
  visited them, and unseduced by the allurements of more southerly
  climes, he boldly sets forth to breast the mountains and brave the
  blasts of Scandinavia, and to form his own judgment of the country
  and its inhabitants. Almost, however, before putting foot on
  Scandinavian ground, Mr Boas, who, as a traveller, is decidedly of
  the gossiping and inquisitive class, fills three chapters with all
  manner of pleasant chatter about himself, and his feelings, and his
  fancies, and the travelling companions he meets with. His liveliness
  and versatility, and a certain bantering satirical vein, in which he
  occasionally indulges, would have caused us to take his work, had we
  met with it in an English translation, for the production of a French
  rather than a German pen.</p>

  <p>Leaving the railway at Angermunde, our traveller continues his
  journey by the mail, in which he has two companions; a lady,
  &quot;with an arm like ivory,&quot; about whom he seems more than
  half inclined to build up a little episodical romance, and a young
  man from the neighbouring town of Pasewalk, &quot;on whose thick
  lips,&quot; we are informed, &quot;the genius of stupidity seemed to
  have established its throne.&quot; This youth expressed his great
  regret that the good old customs of Germany had become obsolete, and
  expatiated on the necessity of striving to restore them. &quot;Those
  were fine times,&quot; he said, &quot;when nobles made war on their
  own account, burned down the villages, and drove the cattle of the
  peasants on each other&#39;s territory. To themselves personally,
  however, they did no harm; and if by chance Ritter Jobst fell into
  the hands of Ritter Kurt, the latter would say, &#39;Ritter Jobst,
  you are my prisoner on parole, and must pay me a ransom of five
  hundred thalers.&#39; And thereupon they passed their time right
  joyously together, drinking and hunting the livelong day. But Ritter
  Jobst wrote to his seneschal that, by fair means or foul, he must
  squeeze the five hundred thalers out of his subjects, who were in
  duty bound to pay, to enable their gracious lord to return home
  again. Those were the times,&quot; concluded the young Pasewalker,
  &quot;and of such times should I like to witness the
  return.&quot;</p>

  <p>Now, Mr Boas considerably disapproved of these aspirations after
  the days of the robber knights, and he accordingly, to avoid hearing
  any more of them, took a nap in his corner, which helped him on
  nearly to Stralsund.</p>

  <p>&quot;This city,&quot; he says, &quot;has acquired an undeserved
  renown through Wallenstein&#39;s famous vow, &#39;to have it, though
  it were hung from heaven by chains.&#39; This puts me in mind of the
  trick of a reviewer who, by enormous and exaggerated praise, induces
  us to read the stupid literary production of some dear friend of his
  own. We take up the book with great expectations, and find
  it&#8212;trash. It is easy to see that Stralsund was founded by a set
  of dirty fish-dealers. Clumsy, gable-ended houses, streets narrow and
  crooked, a wretched pavement&#8212;such is the city. A small road
  along the shore, encumbered with timber, old casks, filth and
  rubbish&#8212;such is the quay.&quot;</p>

  <p>In this uninteresting place, Mr Boas is compelled to pass
  eight-and-forty hours, waiting for a steamer. He fills up the time
  with a little dissertation on Swedish and Pomeranian dialects, and
  with a comical legend about a greedy monk, who bartered his soul to
  the devil for a platter of lampreys. By a stratagem of the
  abbot&#39;s, Satan was outwitted; and, taking himself off in a great
  rage, he dropped the lampreys in the lake of <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> Madue,
  near Stargard, where to this day they are found in as great
  perfection as in the lakes of Italy and Switzerland. This
  peculiarity, however, might be accounted for otherwise than by
  infernal means, for Frederick the Great was equally successful in
  introducing the sturgeon of the Wolga into Pomeranian waters, where
  it is still to be met with.</p>

  <p>A day&#39;s sail brings our traveller to the port of Ystad, where
  he receives his first impressions of Sweden, which are decidedly
  favourable. At sunrise the next morning he goes on board the steamer
  Svithiod, bound from Lubeck to Stockholm. At the same time with
  himself are shipped three wandering Tyrolese musicians, who are
  proceeding northwards to give the Scandinavians a taste of their
  mountain melodies, and two or three hundred pigs, all pickled; the
  pigs, that is to say. He finds on board a numerous and agreeable
  society, of which and of the passage he gives a graphic
  description.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The ship&#39;s bell rang to summon us to breakfast. There is
    a certain epic copiousness about a Swedish <i>frukost</i>. On first
    getting up in the morning it is customary to take a <i>Kop caffe
    med skorpor</i>, a cup of coffee and a biscuit, and in something
    less than two hours later one sits down to a most abundant meal.
    This commences with a <i>sup</i>, that is to say, a glass of
    carraway or aniseed brandy; then come tea, bread and butter, ham,
    sausage, cheese and beer; and the whole winds up with a warm
    <i>KÃ¶ttrÃ¤tt</i>, a beefsteak or cutlet.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Truly a solid and savoury repast. Whilst discussing it in the
  cabin of the Svithiod, Mr Boas makes acquaintance with his
  fellow-voyagers.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;At the top of the table sat our captain, a jovial pleasant
    man. He was very attentive to the passengers, had a prompt and
    friendly answer to every question; in short, he was a Swede all
    over. Near him were placed the families of two clergymen, in whose
    charge was also travelling a young Swedish countess, a charming,
    innocent-looking child, whose large dark eyes seemed destined, at
    no very distant period, to give more than one heartache. Beside
    them was a tall man, plainly dressed, and of military appearance.
    This was Count S&#8212;&#8212;, (Schwerin, probably,) a descendant
    of that friend and lieutenant of Frederick the Great who, on the
    6th May 1757, purchased with his life the victory of Prague. He was
    returning from the hay-harvest on those estates which had belonged
    to his valiant forefather, whose heirs had long been kept out of
    them for lack of certain documents. But Frederick William III.
    said, &#39;Right is right, though wax and parchment be not there to
    prove it;&#39; and he restored to the family their property, which
    is worth half-a-million.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The Count&#39;s neighbour was Fru Nyberg, a Swedish poetess,
    who writes under the name of Euphrosyne. In Germany, nobody
    troubles himself about the &#39;Dikter af Euphrosyne,&#39; but
    every educated Swede knows them and their authoress. The latter may
    once have been handsome, but wrinkles have now crept in where roses
    formerly bloomed. Euphrosyne was born in 1785&#8212;authoresses
    purchase their fame dearly enough at the price of having their age
    put down in every lexicon. A black tulle cap with flame-coloured
    ribands covered her head; round her neck she wore a string of large
    amber beads, a gold watch-chain, and a velvet riband from which her
    eyeglass was suspended. She was quiet, and retiring, spoke little,
    and passed the greater portion of the day in the cabin. Fru Nyberg
    was returning from Paris, and had with her a young lady of
    distinguished family, Emily Holmberg by name. This young person
    possesses a splendid musical talent; her compositions are
    remarkable for charming originality, and are so much the more
    prized that the muse of Harmony has hitherto been but niggard of
    her gifts to the sons and daughters of Sweden. There was something
    particularly delicate and fairy-like in the whole appearance of
    this maiden, whose long curls floated round her transparent white
    temples, while her soft dove-like eyes had a sweet and slightly
    melancholy expression.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Next to Miss Holmberg, there sat a handsome young man, in a
    sort of loose caftan of green velvet. His name was Baron
    R&#8212;&#8212;, and he was a <span class='pagenum'><a name=
    "Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> descendant of the man who
    cast lots with AnkarstrÃ¶m and Horn, which of them should kill the
    King. He had formerly been one of the most noted lions and
    <i>viveurs</i> of Stockholm, but had latterly taken to himself a
    beautiful wife, and had become a more settled character; though his
    exuberant spirits and love of enjoyment still remained, and
    rendered him the gayest and most agreeable of travelling
    companions. Nagel, the celebrated violin player, and his lively
    little wife, were also among the passengers. They were returning
    from America, where he had been exchanging his silvery notes
    against good gold coin. Nagel is a Jew by birth, a most
    accomplished man, speaking seven languages with equal elegance, and
    much esteemed in the musical circles of Stockholm.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>A young Swedish woman, named Maria, whose affecting little history
  Mr Boas learns and tells us&#8212;an Englishman&#8212;&quot;a
  thorough Englishman, who, as long as he was eating, had no eyes or
  ears for any thing else,&quot; and a French <i>commis voyageur</i>,
  travelling to get orders for coloured papers, champagne, and silk
  goods, completed the list of all those of the party who were any way
  worthy of mention. The Frenchman, Monsieur Robineau by name, had a
  little ugly face, nearly hidden by an enormous beard, wore a red cap
  upon his head, and looked altogether like a bandy-legged brownie or
  gnome. The scene at daybreak the next morning is described with some
  humour.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;A dull twilight reigned in the cabin, the lamp was burning
    low and threatening to go out, the first glimmer of day was
    stealing in through the windows, and the Englishman had struck a
    light in order to shave himself. From each berth some different
    description of noise was issuing; the Lubecker was snoring loudly,
    Baron R&#8212;&#8212; was twanging a guitar, Monsieur Robineau
    singing a barcarole, and every body was calling out as loud as he
    could for something or other. Karl, the steward, was rushing up and
    down the cabin, so confused by the fifty different demands
    addressed to him, that he knew not how to comply with any one of
    them.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">

  <p>Aided by the various talents and eccentricities of the passengers,
  by the grimaces of the Frenchman, and the songs of the Tyrolese
  minstrels, the time passed pleasantly enough; till, on the morning of
  the third day after leaving Ystad, the Svithiod was at the entrance
  of Lake Maeler, opposite the fortress of Waxholm, which presents more
  of a picturesque than of an imposing appearance.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;It consists of a few loopholed parapets and ramparts, and of
    a strong round tower of grey stone, looking very romantic but not
    very formidable, and nevertheless entirely commanding the narrow
    passage. A sentry, wrapped in his cloak, stood upon the wall and
    hailed us through a speaking-trumpet. At the very moment that the
    captain was about to answer, another steamer came round a bend of
    the channel, meeting the Svithiod point-blank. The sentinel
    impatiently repeated his summons, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
    "Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> and for a moment there
    appeared to be some danger of our either running foul of the other
    boat, or getting a shot in our hull from the fort. They do not
    understand joking at Waxholm, as was learned a short time since to
    his cost by the commander of the Russian steamer Ischora, who did
    not reply when summoned. Hastily furnishing the required
    information to the castle, our captain shouted out the needful
    orders to his crew, and we passed on in safety.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The steamer which we now met bore the Swedish flag, and was
    conveying the Crown Prince Oscar (the grandson of a lawyer and a
    silk-mercer) and his wife, to Germany. They had left Stockholm in
    the night time, to avoid all public ceremony and formality. A crowd
    of artillerymen now lined the walls of Waxholm to give the usual
    salute, and we could hear the booming of the guns long after we
    were out of sight of ship and fort. In another hour I obtained my
    first view of Stockholm.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Stockholm, the Venice of the North, has been thought by many
  travellers to present a more striking <i>coup-d&#39;&#339;il</i> than
  any other European capital, Constantinople excepted. Built upon seven
  islands, formed by inlets of the sea and the Maeler Lake, it spreads
  over a surface very large in proportion to the number of its houses
  and inhabitants, and exhibits a singular mixture of streets, squares,
  and churches, with rock, wood, and water. The ground on which it
  stands is uneven, and in many places declivitous; the different parts
  of the city are connected by bridges, and on every side is seen the
  fresh green foliage of the north. The natural canals which intersect
  Stockholm are of great depth, and ships of large burden are enabled
  to penetrate into the very heart of the town. The general style of
  building offers little to admire; the houses being for the most part
  flat-fronted, monotonous, and graceless, without any species of
  architectural decoration to relieve their inelegant uniformity. It is
  the position of the city, the air of lightness given to it by the
  water, which traverses it in every direction, and the life and
  movement of the port, that form its chief recommendations. In their
  architectural ideas the Swedes appear to be entirely utilitarian,
  disdainful of ornament; and if a house of more modern and tasteful
  build, with windows of a handsome size, cornices, and entablatures,
  is here and there to be met with, it is almost certain to have been
  erected by Germans or some other foreigners. The royal palace, of
  which the first stone was laid in the reign of Charles XII., is a
  well-conceived and finely executed work; some of the churches are
  also worthy of notice; but most of the public buildings derive their
  chief interest, like the squares and market-places, from their
  antiquity, or from historical associations connected with them. Few
  cities offer richer stores to the lovers of the romance of history
  than does the capital of Sweden. One edifice alone, the
  Ritterhaus&#8212;literally, the House of Knights or Lords&#8212;in
  which the Swedish nobility were wont to hold their Diets, would
  furnish subject-matter for a score of romances. Not a door nor a
  window, scarce a stone in the building, but tells of some sanguinary
  feud, or fierce insurrection of the populace, in the troublous days
  of Sweden. From floor to ceiling of the great hall in which the Diet
  held its sittings, hang the coats of arms of Swedish counts, barons,
  and noblemen. A solemn gloomy light pervades the apartment, and
  unites with the grave black-blue coverings of the seats and
  balustrades, to convey the idea that this is no arena for showy
  shallow orators, but a place in which stern truth and naked reality
  have been wont to prevail. The chair of Gustavus Vasa, of inlaid
  ivory, and covered with purple velvet, stands in this room.</p>

  <p>Mr Boas, the pages of whose book are thickly strewn with legends
  and historical anecdotes, many of them interesting, devotes a chapter
  to the Ritterhaus and its annals. One tragical history, connected
  with that building, appears worthy of extraction:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;One of the chief favourites of Gustavus III. was Count
    Armfelt, a young man of illustrious family, and of unusual mental
    and personal accomplishments. At an early age he entered the royal
    guards, and proved, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id=
    "Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> during the war with Russia, that his
    courage in the field fully equalled his more courtierlike merits.
    He rapidly ascended in military grade, and, finally, the king
    appointed him governor of Stockholm, and named him President of the
    Council of Regency, which, in case of his death, was to govern
    Sweden during the minority of the heir to the throne. Shortly after
    these dignities had been conferred upon Armfelt, occurred the
    famous masquerade and the assassination of Gustavus.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Upon this event happening, a written will of the king&#39;s
    was produced, of more recent date than the appointment of the
    Count, and, according to which, the guardianship of the Prince
    Royal was to devolve upon Duke Karl Sundermanland, the brother of
    Gustavus. This was a weak, sensual, and vindictive prince, of
    limited capacity, and easily led by flattery and deceit. He
    belonged to a secret society, of which Baron Reuterholm was
    grand-master. A couple of mysterious and well-managed apparitions
    were sufficient to terrify the duke, and render him ductile as wax.
    The most implicit submission was required of him, and soon the
    crafty Reuterholm got the royal authority entirely into his own
    hands. There was discontent and murmuring amongst the true friends
    of the royal family, but Reuterholm&#39;s spies were ubiquitous,
    and a frowning brow or dissatisfied look was punished as a crime.
    Amongst others, Count Armfelt, who took no pains to conceal his
    indignation at the scandalous proceedings of those in power, was
    stripped of his offices, and ordered to set out immediately as
    ambassador to Naples.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;This command fell like a thunderbolt upon the head of the
    Count, whom every public and private consideration combined to
    retain in Stockholm. Loath as he was to leave his country an
    undisputed prey to the knaves into whose hands it had fallen, he
    was perhaps still more unwilling to abandon one beloved being to
    the snares and dangers of a sensual and corrupt court.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;It was on a September evening of the year 1792, and the light
    of the moon fell cold and clear upon the white houses of Stockholm,
    though the streets that intersected their masses were plunged in
    deep shadow, when a man, muffled in a cloak, and evidently desirous
    of avoiding observation, was seen making his way hastily through
    the darkest and least frequented lanes of that city. Stopping at
    last, he knocked thrice against a window-shutter; an adjacent door
    was opened at the signal, and he passed through a corridor into a
    cheerful and well-lighted apartment. Throwing off his cloak, he
    received and returned the affectionate greeting of a beautiful
    woman, who advanced with outstretched hand to meet him. The
    stranger was Count Armfelt&#8212;the lady, Miss
    RudenskjÃ¶ld&#8212;the most charming of the court beauties of the
    day. The colour left her cheek when she perceived the uneasiness of
    her lover; but when he told her of the orders he had received, her
    head sank upon his breast, and her large blue eyes swam in tears.
    Recovering, however, from this momentary depression, she vowed to
    remain ever true to her country and her love. The Count echoed the
    vow, and a kiss sealed the compact. The following morning a ship
    sailed from Stockholm, bearing the new ambassador to Naples.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Scarcely had Armfelt departed, when Duke Karl began to
    persecute Miss RudenskjÃ¶ld with his addresses. At first he
    endeavoured, by attention and flatteries, to win her favour; but
    her avoidance of his advances and society increased the violence of
    his passion, until at last he spoke his wishes with brutal
    frankness. With maidenly pride and dignity, the lady repelled his
    suit, and severely stigmatized his insolence. Foaming with rage,
    the duke left her presence, and from that moment his love was
    exchanged for a deadly hatred.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Baron Reuterholm had witnessed with pleasure the growth of
    the regent&#39;s passion for the beautiful Miss RudenskjÃ¶ld; for he
    knew that the more pursuits Duke Karl had to occupy and amuse him,
    the more undivided would be his own sway. It was with great
    dissatisfaction, therefore, that he received an account of the
    contemptuous manner in which the proud girl had treated her royal
    admirer. The latter insisted upon revenge, full and complete
    revenge, and Reuterholm promised that he should <span class=
    'pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> have
    it. Miss RudenskjÃ¶ld&#39;s life was so blameless, and her conduct
    in every respect so correct, that it seemed impossible to invent
    any charge against her; but Reuterholm set spies to work, and spies
    will always discover something. They found out that she kept up a
    regular correspondence with Count Armfelt. Their letters were
    opened, and evidence found in them of a plan to declare the young
    prince of age, or at least to abstract Duke Karl from the
    corrupting influence of Reuterholm. The angry feelings entertained
    by the latter personage towards Miss RudenskjÃ¶ld were increased
    tenfold by this discovery, and he immediately had her thrown into
    prison. She was brought to trial before a tribunal composed of
    creatures of the baron, and including the Chancellor Sparre, a man
    of unparalleled cunning and baseness, than whom Satan himself could
    have selected no better advocate. During her examination, Fraulein
    von RudenskjÃ¶ld was most cruelly treated, and the words of the
    correspondence were distorted, with infamous subtlety, into
    whatever construction best suited her accusers. Sparre twisted his
    physiognomy, which in character partook of that of the dog and the
    serpent, into a thoughtful expression, and regretted that,
    according to the Swedish laws, the offence of which Miss
    RudenskjÃ¶ld was found guilty, could not be punished by the lash.
    The pillory, and imprisonment in the Zuchthaus, the place of
    confinement for the most guilty and abandoned of her sex, formed
    the scarce milder sentence pronounced upon the unfortunate victim.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;It was early on an autumn morning&#8212;a thick canopy of
    grey clouds overspread the heavens&#8212;and the dismal half-light
    which prevailed in the streets of Stockholm made it difficult to
    decide whether or not the sun had yet risen. A cold wind blew
    across from Lake Maeler, and caused the few persons who had as yet
    left their houses to hasten their steps along the deserted
    pavement. Suddenly a detachment of soldiers arrived upon the square
    in front of the Ritterhaus, and took up their station beside the
    pillory. The officer commanding the party was a slender young man
    of agreeable countenance; but he was pale as death, and his voice
    trembled as he gave the words of command. The prison-gate now
    opened, and Miss RudenskjÃ¶ld came forth, escorted by several
    jailers. Her cheeks were whiter than the snow-white dress she wore;
    her limbs trembled; her long hair hung in wild dishevelment over
    her shoulders, and yet was she beautiful&#8212;beautiful as a
    fading rose. They led her up the steps of the pillory, and the
    executioner&#39;s hand was already stretched out to bind her to the
    ignominious post, when she cast a despairing glance upon the
    bystanders, as though seeking aid. As she did so, a shrill scream
    of agony burst from her lips. She had recognised in the young
    officer her own dearly-loved brother, who, by a devilish refinement
    of cruelty, had been appointed to command the guard that was to
    attend at her punishment.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Strong in her innocence, the delicate and gently-nurtured
    girl had borne up against all her previous sufferings; but this was
    too much. Her senses left her, and she fell fainting to the ground.
    Her brother also swooned away, and never recovered his unclouded
    reason. To his dying day his mind remained gloomy and unsettled.
    The very executioners refused to inflict further indignity on the
    senseless girl, and she was conducted back to her dungeon, where
    she soon recovered all the firmness which she had already displayed
    before her infamous judges.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Meanwhile Armfelt was exposed in Italy to the double danger
    of secret assassination, and of a threatened requisition from the
    Swedish government for him to be delivered up. He sought safety in
    flight, and found an asylum in Germany. His estates were
    confiscated, his titles, honours, and nobility declared forfeit,
    and he himself was condemned by default as a traitor to his
    country.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Concerning the ultimate fate of this luckless pair of lovers, Mr
  Boas deposeth not, but passes on to an account of the disturbances in
  1810, when the Swedish marshal, Count Axel Fersen, suspected by the
  populace as cause of the sudden death of the Crown Prince, Charles
  Augustus, was attacked, while following the body of the prince
  through the streets of Stockholm. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> He was sitting in full
  uniform in his carriage, drawn by six milk-white horses, when he was
  assailed with showers of stones, from which he took refuge in a house
  upon the Ritterhaustmarkt. In spite of the exertions of General
  Silversparre, at the head of some dragoons, the mob broke into the
  house, and entered the room in which Fersen was. He folded his hands,
  and begged for mercy, protesting his innocence. But his entreaties
  were in vain. A broad-shouldered fellow, a shopkeeper, named Lexow,
  tore off his orders, sword, and cloak, and threw them through the
  window to the rioters, who with furious shouts reduced them to
  fragments. Silversparre then proposed to take the count to prison,
  and have him brought to trial in due form. But, on the way thither,
  the crowd struck and ill-treated the old man; and, although numerous
  troops were now upon the spot, these remained with shouldered arms,
  and even their officers forbade their interference. They appeared to
  be there to attend an execution rather than to restore order. The mob
  dragged the unfortunate Fersen to the foot of Gustavus Vasa&#39;s
  statue, and there beat and ill-treated him till he died. It was
  remarked of the foremost and most eager of his persecutors, that
  although dressed as common sailors, their hands were white and
  delicate, and linen of fine texture peeped betrayingly forth from
  under their coarse outer garments. Doubtless more than one
  long-standing hatred was on that day gratified. It was still borne in
  mind, that Count Fersen&#39;s father had been the chief instrument in
  bringing Count Eric Brahe, and several other nobles, to the scaffold,
  upon the very spot where, half a century later, his son&#39;s blood
  was poured out.</p>

  <p>The murder of the Count-Marshal was followed by an attack upon the
  house of his sister, the Countess Piper; but she had had timely
  notice, and escaped by water to Waxholm. Several officers of rank,
  who strove to pacify the mob, were abused, and even beaten; until at
  length a combat ensued between the troops and the people, and lasted
  till nightfall, when an end was put to it by a heavy fall of rain.
  The number of killed and wounded on that day could never be
  ascertained.</p>

  <p>These incidents are striking and dramatic&#8212;fine stuff for
  novel writers, as Mr Boas says&#8212;but we will turn to less
  sanguinary subjects. In a letter to a female friend, who is
  designated by the fanciful name of Eglantine, we have a sketch of the
  present state of Swedish poetry and literature. According to the
  account here given us, Olof von Dalin, who was born in Holland in
  1763, was the first to awaken in the Swedes a real and correct taste
  for the <i>belles lettres</i>. This he did in great measure by the
  establishment of a periodical called the <i>Argus</i>. He improved
  the style of prose writing, and produced some poetry, which latter
  appears, however, to have been generally more remarkable for
  sweetness than power. We have not space to follow Mr Boas through his
  gallery of Swedish <i>literati</i>, but we will extract what he says
  concerning three authoresses, whose works, highly popular in their
  own country and in Germany, have latterly attracted some attention in
  England. These are&#8212;Miss Bremer, Madame Flygare-CarlÃ©n, and the
  Baroness Knorring, the delineators of domestic, rural, and
  aristocratic life in Sweden.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Frederica Bremer was born in the year 1802. After the death
    of her father, a rich merchant and proprietor of mines, she resided
    at Schonen, and subsequently with a female friend in Norway. She
    now lives with her mother and sister alternately in the Norrlands
    Gatan, at Stockholm, or at their country seat at Arsta. If I were
    to talk to you about Miss Bremer&#39;s romances, you would laugh at
    me, for you are doubtless ten times better acquainted with them
    than I am. But you are curious, perhaps, to learn something about
    her appearance, and <i>that</i> I can tell you.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;You will not expect to hear that Miss Bremer, a maiden lady
    of forty, retains a very large share of youthful bloom; but,
    independently of that, she is really any thing but handsome. Her
    thin wrinkled physiognomy is, however, rendered agreeable by its
    good-humoured expression, and her meagre figure has the benefit of
    a neat and simple style of dress. From the style of her writings, I
    used always to take <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id=
    "Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> her to be a governess; and she looks
    exactly like one. She knows that she is not handsome, and on that
    account has always refused to have her portrait taken; the one they
    sell of her in Germany is a counterfeit, the offspring of an
    artist&#39;s imagination, stimulated by speculative book-sellers.
    This summer, there was a quizzing paragraph in one of the Swedish
    papers, saying that a painter had been sent direct from America to
    Rome and Stockholm, to take portraits of the Pope and of Miss
    Bremer.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;In Sweden, the preference is given to her romance of
    <i>Hemmet</i>, (Home,) over all her other works. Any thing like a
    bold originality of invention she is generally admitted to lack,
    but she is skilled in throwing a poetical charm over the quiet
    narrow circle of domestic life. She is almost invariably successful
    in her female characters, but when she attempts to draw those of
    men, her creations are mere caricatures, full of emptiness and
    improbability. Her habit of indulging in a sort of aimless and
    objectless philosophizing vein, <i>Ã  propos</i> of nothing at all,
    is also found highly wearisome. For my part, it has often given me
    an attack of nausea. She labours, however, diligently to improve
    herself; and, when I saw her, she had just been ordering at a
    bookseller&#39;s two German works&#8212;Bossen&#39;s <i>Translation
    of Homer</i>, and Creuzer&#39;s <i>Symbolics</i>.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Emily Flygare is about thirty years of age. She is the
    daughter of a country clergyman, and has only to write down her own
    recollections in order to depict village life, with its pains and
    its pleasures. Accordingly, that is her strongest line in
    authorship; and her book, <i>Kyrkoinvigningen</i>, (the Church
    Festival,) has been particularly successful. Married in early life
    to an officer, she contracted, after his death, several
    engagements, all of which she broke off, whereby her reputation in
    some degree suffered. At last she gave her hand to CarlÃ©n, a very
    middling sort of poet, some years younger than she is; and she now
    styles herself&#8212;following the example of Madame
    Birch-Pfeiffer, and other celebrated singers&#8212;Flygare-CarlÃ©n.
    She lives very happily at Stockholm with her husband, and is at
    least as good a housewife as an authoress, not even thinking it
    beneath her dignity to superintend the kitchen. Her great modesty
    as to her own merits, and the esteem she expresses for her rivals,
    are much to her credit. She is a little restless body, and does not
    like sitting still. Her countenance is rather pleasing than
    handsome, and its charm is heightened by the lively sparkle of her
    quick dark eyes.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The third person of the trio is the Baroness Knorring, a very
    noble lady, who lives far away from Stockholm, and is married to an
    officer. She is between thirty and forty years old, and it is
    affirmed that she would be justified in exclaiming with
    Wallenstein&#39;s Thekla&#8212;

    She was described to me as nervous and delicate, which is perhaps
    the right temperament to enable her accurately to depict in her
    romances the strained artificiality and silken softness of
    aristocratic existence. Her style also possesses the needful
    lightness and grace, and she accordingly succeeds admirably in her
    sketches of high life, with all its elegant nullities and
    spiritless pomp. One of her best works is the romance of
    <i>Cousinerna</i>, (The Cousins,) which, as well as the other works
    of Knorring, Bremer, and Flygare, has been placed before the German
    public by our diligent translators.&quot;
  </div><br />

  <p>Upon the subjects of Swedish society and conversation, Mr Boas is
  pleased to be unusually funny. Like the foreigner who asserted that
  Goddam was the root of the English language, he seems prepared to
  maintain that two monosyllables constitute the essence of the Swedish
  tongue, and that they alone are required to carry on an effective and
  agreeable dialogue. &quot;It is not at all difficult,&quot; he says,
  &quot;to keep up a conversation with a Swede, when you are once
  acquainted with a certain mystical formula, whereby all emotions and
  sentiments are to be expressed, and by the aid of which you may love
  and hate, curse and bless, be good-humoured or satirical, and even
  witty. The mighty and all-sufficing words are, &#39;<i>Ja
  so!</i>&#39; (Yes, indeed!) usually <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> pronounced <i>Jassoh</i>.
  It is wonderful to hear the infinite variety of modulation which a
  Swede gives to these two insignificant syllables. Does he hear some
  agreeable intelligence, he exclaims, with sparkling eyes and brisk
  intonation, &#39;Ja so!&#39; If bad news are brought to him, he
  droops his head, and, after a pause, murmurs mournfully, &#39;Ja
  so!&#39; The communication of an important affair is received with a
  thoughtful &#39;Ja so!&#39; a joke elicits a humorous one; an attempt
  to banter or deceive him is met by a sarcastic repetition of the same
  mysterious words.</p>

    &quot;A romance might be constructed out of these four letters.
    Thus:&#8212;Lucy is sitting at her window, when a well-known
    messenger brings her a bouquet. She joyfully exclaims, &#39;Ja
    so!&#39; and presses the flowers to her lips. A friend comes in;
    she shows her the flowers, and the friend utters an envious &#39;Ja
    so!&#39; Soon afterwards Lucy&#39;s lover hears that she is
    faithless; he gnashes his teeth, and vociferates a furious &#39;Ja
    so!&#39; He writes to tell her that he despises her, and will never
    see her again; whereupon she weeps, and says to herself, between
    two tears, &#39;Ja so!&#39; She manages, however, to see him, and
    convinces him that she has been calumniated. He clasps her in his
    arms, and utters a &#39;Ja so!&#39; expressive of entire
    conviction. Suddenly his brow becomes clouded, and muttering a
    meditative &#39;Ja so!&#39; he remembers that a peremptory
    engagement compels him to leave her. He seeks out the man who has
    sought to rob him of his mistress, and reproaches him with his
    perfidy. This rival replies by a cold, scornful &#39;Ja so!&#39;
    and a meeting is agreed upon. The next day they exchange shots, and
    I fully believe that the man who is killed sighs out with his last
    breath &#39;Ja so!&#39; His horror-stricken antagonist exclaims
    &#39;Ja so!&#39; and flies the country; and surgeon, relations,
    friends, judge, all, in short, who hear of the affair, will
    inevitably cry out, &#39;Ja so!&#39; Grief and joy, doubt and
    confidence, jest and anger, are all to be rendered by those two
    words.&quot;

  <p>The province of Dalarna, or Dalecarlia, which lies between
  Nordland and the Norwegian frontier, and in which Miss Bremer has
  laid the scene of one of her most recent works, is spoken of at some
  length by Mr Boas, who considers it to be, in various respects, the
  most interesting division of Sweden. Its inhabitants, unable to find
  means of subsistence in their own poor and mountainous land, are in
  the habit of wandering forth to seek a livelihood in more kindly
  regions, and Mr Boas likens them in this respect to the Savoyards.
  They might, perhaps, be more aptly compared to the Galicians, who
  leave their country, not, as many of the Savoyards do, to become
  beggars and vagabonds, by the aid of a marmoset and a grinding organ,
  but to strive, by the hardest labour and most rigid economy, to
  accumulate a sum that will enable them to return and end their lives
  in their native village.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The dress of the Dalecarlians (<i>dale carls</i>, or men of
    the valley) consists of a sort of doublet and leathern apron, to
    the latter of which garments they get so accustomed that they
    scarcely lay it aside even on Sundays. Above that they wear a short
    overcoat of white flannel. Their round hats are decorated with red
    tufts, and their breeches fastened at the knees with red ties and
    tassels. The costume of their wives and daughters, who are called
    Dalecullen, (women of the valley,) is yet more peculiar and
    outlandish. It is composed of a coloured cap, fitting close to the
    head, of a boddice with red laces, a gown, usually striped with red
    and green, and of scarlet stockings. They wear enormous shoes,
    large, awkward, and heavy, made of the very thickest leather, and
    adorned with the eternal red frippery. The soles are an inch thick,
    with huge heels, stuck full of nails, and placed, not where the
    heel of the foot is, but in front, under the toes; and as these
    remarkable shoes <i>lift</i> at every step, the heels of the
    stockings are covered with leather. On Sundays, ample white
    shirt-sleeves, broad cap-ribands, and large wreaths of flowers are
    added to this singular garb, amongst the wearers of which pretty
    faces and laughing blue eyes are by no means uncommon.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The occupations of these women are of the rudest and most
    laborious description. They may be literally <span class=
    'pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> said to
    earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, and their hands are
    rendered callous as horn by the nature of their toil. They act as
    bricklayers&#39; labourers, and carry loads of stones upon their
    shoulders and up ladders. Besides this, it is a monopoly of theirs
    to row a sort of boat, which is impelled by machinery imitating
    that of a steamer, but worked by hand. These are tolerably large
    vessels, having paddle-wheels fitted to them, which are turned from
    within. Each wheel is worked by two young Dalecarlian girls, who
    perform this severe labour with the utmost cheerfulness, while an
    old woman steers. They pass their lives upon the water, plying from
    earliest dawn till late in the night, and conveying passengers, for
    a trifling copper coin, across the broad canals which intersect
    Stockholm in every direction. Cheerful and pious, the bloom of
    health on her cheeks, and the fear of God in her heart, the
    Dalecarlian maiden is contented in her humble calling. On Sunday
    she would sooner lose a customer than miss her attendance at
    church. One sorrowful feeling, and only one, at times saddens her
    heart, and that is the <i>Heimweh</i>, the yearning after her
    native valley, when she longs to return to her wild and beautiful
    country, which the high mountains encircle, and the bright stream
    of the Dalelf waters. There she has her father and mother, or
    perhaps a lover, as poor as herself, and she sees no possibility of
    ever earning enough to enable her to return home, and become his
    wife.

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;It was in this province that I now found myself, and its
    inhabitants pleased me greatly. Nature has made them hardy and
    intelligent, for their life is a perpetual struggle to extract a
    scanty subsistence from the niggard and rocky soil. Unenervated by
    luxury, uncorrupted by the introduction of foreign vices, they have
    been at all periods conspicuous for their love of freedom, for
    their penetration in discovering, and promptness in repelling,
    attacks upon it. Faithful to their lawful sovereign, they yet
    brooked no tyranny; and when invaders entered the land, or bad
    governors oppressed them, they were ever ready to defend their just
    rights with their lives. From the remotest periods, such has been
    the character of this people, which has preserved itself
    unsophisticated, true, and free. It is interesting to trace the
    history of the Dalecarlians. Isolated in a manner from the rest of
    the world amongst their rugged precipices and in their lonely
    valleys, it might be supposed they would know nothing of what
    passed without; yet whenever the moment for action has come, they
    have been found alert and prepared.

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;At the commencement of the fifteenth century, Eric XIII.,
    known also as the Pomeranian, ascended the Swedish throne. His own
    disposition was neither bad nor good, but he had too little
    knowledge of the country he was called upon to reign over; and his
    governors and vice-gerents, for the most part foreigners,
    tyrannized unsparingly over the nation. The oppressed people
    stretched out their hands imploringly to the king; but he, who was
    continually requiring fresh supplies of money for the prosecution
    of objectless wars, paid no attention to their complaints. Of all
    his VÃ¶gte, or governors, not one was so bad and cruel as Jesse
    Ericson, who dwelt at Westeraes, and ruled over Dalarna. He laid
    enormous imposts on the peasantry, and when they were unable to
    pay, he took every thing from them, to their last horse, and
    harnessed themselves to the plough. Pregnant matrons were compelled
    at his command to draw heavy hay-waggons, women and girls were
    shamefully outraged by him, and persons possessing property
    unjustly condemned, in order that he might take possession of their
    goods. When the peasants came to him to complain, he had them
    driven away with stripes, or else cut off their ears, or hung them
    up in the smoke till they were suffocated.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Then the men of Dalarna murmured; they assembled in their
    valleys, and held counsel together. An insurrection was decided
    upon, and Engelbrecht of Falun was chosen to head it, because,
    although small of stature, he had a courageous heart, and knew how
    to talk or to fight, as occasion required. He repaired to
    Copenhagen, laid the just complaints of his countrymen before the
    king, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg
    66]</a></span> and pledged his head to prove their truth. Eric gave
    him a letter to the counsellors of state, some of whom accompanied
    him back to Dalarna, and convinced themselves that the distress of
    the province was inconceivably great. They exposed this state of
    things to the king in a letter, with which Engelbrecht returned to
    Copenhagen. But, on seeking audience of Eric, the latter cried out
    angrily, &#39;You do nothing but complain! Go your ways, and appear
    no more before me.&#39; So Engelbrecht departed, but he murmured as
    he went, &#39;Yet once more will I return.&#39;
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Although the counsellors themselves urged the king to appoint
    another governor over Dalecarlia, he did not think fit to do so.
    Then, in the year 1434, so soon as the sun had melted the snow, the
    Dalecarlians rose up as one man, marched through the country, and
    Jesse Ericson fled before them into Denmark. They destroyed the
    dwellings of their oppressors, drove away their hirelings and
    retainers, and Engelbrecht advanced, with a thousand picked men, to
    Wadstena, where he found an assembly of bishops and counsellors.
    From these he demanded assistance, but they refused to accord it,
    until Engelbrecht took the bishop of LinkÃ¶ping by the collar, to
    deliver him over to his followers. Thereupon they became more
    tractable, and renounced in writing their allegiance to Eric, on
    the grounds that he had &#39;made bishops of ignorant ribalds,
    entrusted high offices to unworthy persons, and neglected to punish
    tyrannical governors.&#39; The Dalecarlians advanced as far as
    Schonen, where Engelbrecht concluded a truce, and dismissed them.
    His army had consisted of ten thousand peasants, all burning with
    anger against their oppressors, and without military discipline;
    yet, to his great credit be it said, not a single excess or act of
    plunder had been committed.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;On hearing of these disturbances, the king repaired in all
    haste to Stockholm, whereupon Engelbrecht again summoned his
    followers, and marched upon the capital, in which Eric entrenched
    himself with various nobles and governors, who had burned down
    their castles, and hastened to join him. Things looked threatening,
    but nevertheless ended peaceably, for Eric was afraid of the
    Swedes. He obtained peace by promising that in future the
    provinces, with few exceptions, should name their own governors,
    and that Engelbrecht should be vÃ¶gt at Oerebro. As usual, however,
    he broke his word, and, before sailing for Denmark, he appointed as
    vÃ¶gt a man who was a notorious pirate, a robber of churches, and
    abuser of women. For the third time the peasants revolted. In the
    winter of 1436 they appeared before Stockholm, which they took, the
    burghers themselves helping them to burst open the gates.
    Engelbrecht seized upon one fortress after another, meeting no
    resistance from King Eric, who fled secretly to Pomerania, leaving
    the war and his kingdom to take care of themselves. Several members
    of the council followed him thither, and, after some persuasion,
    brought him back with them.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;In the midst of these changes and commotions, Engelbrecht was
    treacherously assassinated by the son of that bishop whom he had
    formerly affronted at Wadstena. With tears and lamentations, the
    boors fetched the body of their brave and faithful leader from the
    little island where his death had occurred, and which to this day
    bears his name. The spot on which the murder was committed is said
    to be accursed, and no grass ever grows there. Subsequently the
    coffin was brought to the church at Oerebro, and so exalted was the
    opinion entertained of Engelbrecht&#39;s worth and virtue, that the
    country people asserted that miracles were wrought at his tomb, as
    at the shrine of a saint.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>It was nearly a century later that Gustavus Vasa, flying, with a
  price upon his head, from the assassins of his father and friends,
  took refuge in Dalecarlia. Disguised in peasant&#39;s garb, and with
  an axe in his hand, he hired himself as a labourer; but was soon
  recognised, and his employer feared to retain him in his service. He
  then appealed to the Dalecarlians to espouse his cause; but, although
  they admired and sympathised with the gallant youth who thus placed
  his trust in them, they hesitated to take up arms in his behalf; and,
  hopeless of their assistance, he at last turned <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> his steps
  towards Norway. But scarcely had he done so, when the incursion of a
  band of Danish mercenaries sent to seek him, and the full
  confirmation of what he had told them concerning the massacre at
  Stockholm, roused the Dalecarlians from their inaction. The tocsin
  was sounded throughout the provinces, the Danes were driven away, and
  the two swiftest runners in the country bound on their snow-shoes,
  and set out with the speed of the wind to bring back the royal
  fugitive. They overtook him at the foot of the Norwegian mountains,
  and soon afterwards he found himself at the head of five thousand
  white-coated Dalecarlians.</p>

  <p>The Danes were approaching, and one of their bishops
  asked&#8212;&quot;How many men the province of Dalarna could
  furnish?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;At least twenty thousand,&quot; was the reply; &quot;for the
  old men are just as strong and as brave as the young ones.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But what do they all live upon?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Upon bread and water. They take little account of hunger and
  thirst, and when corn is lacking, they make their bread out of
  tree-bark.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; said the bishop, &quot;a people who eat tree-bark
  and drink water, the devil himself would not vanquish, much less a
  man.&quot;</p>

  <p>And neither were they vanquished. Like an avalanche from the
  mountains, they fell upon their foes, beat them with clubs, and drove
  them into the river. Their progress was one series of triumphs, till
  they placed Gustavus Vasa on the throne of Sweden.</p>

  <p>The last outbreak of the Dalecarlians was less successful. On the
  19th of June 1743, five thousand of these hardy and determined men
  appeared before Stockholm, bringing with them in fetters the governor
  of their province, and demanding the punishment of the nobles who had
  instigated a war with Russia, and a new election of an heir to the
  crown. They were not to be pacified by words; and even the next
  morning, when the old King Frederick, surrounded by his general and
  guards, rode out to harangue them, all he could obtain was the
  release of their prisoner. On the other hand, they seized three
  pieces of cannon, and dragged them to the square named after Gustavus
  Adolphus, where they posted themselves.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;There were eight thousand men of regular troops in Stockholm,
    but these were not all to be depended upon, and it was necessary to
    bring up some detachments of the guards. A company of SÃ¼derlÃ¤nders
    who had been ordered to cross the bridge, went right about face, as
    soon as they came in sight of the Dalecarlians, and did not halt
    till they reached the sluicegate, which had been drawn up, so that
    nobody might pass. It was now proclaimed with beat of drum, that
    those of the Dalecarlians who should not have left the city by five
    o&#39;clock, would be dealt with as rebels and traitors. More than
    a thousand did leave, but the others stood firm. Counsellors and
    generals went to them, and exhorted them to obedience; but they
    cried out that they would make and unmake the king, according to
    their own good right and decree, and that if it was attempted to
    hinder them, the very child in the cradle should meet no mercy at
    their hands. To give greater weight to their words, they fired a
    cannon and a volley of musketry, by which a counsellor was killed.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Orders were now given to the soldiers to fire, but they had
    pity on the poor peasants, and only aimed at the houses, shattering
    the glass in hundreds of windows. But the artillerymen were obliged
    to put match to touch-hole, and a murderous fire of canister did
    execution in the masses of the Dalecarlians. Many a white camisole
    was stained with the red heart&#39;s-blood of its wearer; fifty men
    fell dead upon the spot, eighty were wounded, and a crowd of others
    sprang into the NorderstrÃ¶m, or sought to fly. The regiment of
    body-guards pursued them, and drove the discomfited boors into the
    artillery court. A severe investigation now took place, and these
    thirsters after liberty were punished by imprisonment and running
    the gauntlet. Their leader and five others were beheaded.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The Dalecarlians are a tenacious and obstinate people, and
    their character is not likely to change; but God forbid that they
    should again <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id=
    "Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> deem it necessary to visit Stockholm.
    They were doubtless just as brave in the year 1743 as in 1521 and
    1434; but though <i>they</i> had not altered, the times had.
    Civilization and cartridges are powerful checks upon undisciplined
    courage and an unbridled desire of liberty.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Returning from Dalecarlia to Stockholm, Mr Boas takes, not without
  regret, his final farewell of that city, and embarks for Gothenburg,
  passing through the Gotha canal, that splendid monument of Swedish
  industry and perseverance, which connects the Baltic with the North
  Sea. He passes the island of MÃ¶rkÃ¶, on which is HÃ¶ningsholm Castle,
  where Marshal Banner was brought up. A window is pointed out in the
  third story of the castle, at which Banner, when a child, was once
  playing, when he overbalanced himself and fell out. The ground
  beneath was hard and rocky, but nevertheless he got up unhurt, ran
  into the house, and related how a gardener had saved him by catching
  him in his white apron. Enquiry was immediately made, but, far or
  near, no gardener was to be found. By an odd coincidence,
  Wallenstein, Banner&#39;s great opponent, when a page at Innspruck,
  also fell out of a high window without receiving the least
  injury.</p>

  <p>On the first evening of the voyage, the steamer anchors for the
  night near Mem, a country-seat belonging to a certain Count Saltza,
  an eccentric old nobleman, who traces his descent from the time of
  Charles XII., and fancies himself a prophet and ghost-seer. His
  predictions relate usually to the royal family or country of Sweden,
  and are repeated from mouth to mouth throughout every province of the
  kingdom. And here we must retract an assertion we made some pages
  back, as to the possibility of our supposing this book to proceed
  from any other than a German pen. No one but a German would have
  thought it necessary or judicious to intrude his own insipid
  sentimentalities into a narrative of this description, and which was
  meant to be printed. But there is probably no conceivable subject on
  which a German could be set to write, in discussing which he would
  not manage to drag in, by neck and heels, a certain amount of
  sentiment or metaphysics, perhaps of both. Mr Boas, we are sorry to
  say, is guilty of this sin against good taste. The steamer comes to
  an anchor about ten o&#39;clock, and he goes ashore with Baron
  K&#8212;&#8212;, a friend he has picked up on board, to take a stroll
  in the Prophet&#39;s garden at Mem. There they encounter
  Mesdemoiselles Ebba and Ylfwa, lovely and romantic maidens, who sit
  in a bower of roses under the shadow of an umbrageous maple-tree,
  their arms intertwined, their eyes fixed upon a moonbeam, piping out
  Swedish melodies, which, to our two swains, prove seductive as the
  songs of a Siren. The moonbeam aforesaid is kind enough to convert
  into silver all the trees, bushes, leaves and twigs in the vicinity
  of the young ladies with the Thor-and-Odin names; whilst to complete
  this German vision, a white bird with a yellow tuft upon its head
  stands sentry upon a branch beside them, the said bird being, we
  presume, a filthy squealing cockatoo, although Mr Boas, gay deceiver
  that he is, evidently wishes us to infer that it was an indigenous
  volatile of the ph&#339;nix tribe. Sentinel Cockatoo, however, was
  caught napping, and the garrison of the bower had to run for it. And
  now commences a series of hopes and fears, and doubts and anxieties,
  and sighings and perplexities, which keep the tender heart of Boas in
  a state of agreeable palpitation, through four or five chapters; at
  the end of which he steps on board the steam-boat Christiana, blows
  in imagination a farewell kiss to Miss Ebba, of whom, by the bye, he
  has never obtained more than half a glimpse, and awaking, as he tells
  us, from his love-dream, which we should call his nightmare, sets
  sail for Copenhagen.</p>

  <p>Of the various places visited by Mr Boas during his ramble, few
  seem to have pleased him better than Copenhagen, and he becomes quite
  enthusiastic when speaking of that city, and of what he saw there.
  The pleasure he had in meeting Thorwaldsen is perhaps in part the
  cause of his remembering the Danish capital with peculiar favour. He
  gives various details concerning that celebrated sculptor, his
  character and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id=
  "Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> habits, and commences the chapter, which
  he styles, &quot;A Fragment of Italy in the North,&quot; with a
  comparison between Sweden and Denmark, two countries which, both in
  trifling and important matters, but especially in the character of
  their inhabitants, are far more dissimilar than from their
  juxtaposition might have been supposed. Listen to Mr Boas.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;On meeting an interesting person for the first time, one
    frequently endeavours to trace a resemblance with some previous
    acquaintance or friend. I have a similar propensity when I visit
    interesting cities; but I had difficulty in calling to mind any
    place to which I could liken Copenhagen. Between Sweden and Denmark
    generally, there are more points of difference than of resemblance.
    Sweden is the land of rocks, and Denmark of forest. OehlenschlÃ¤gel
    calls the latter country, &#39;the fresh and grassy,&#39; but he
    might also have added &#39;the cool and wooded.&#39;
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The Swedish language is soft and melodious, the Danish sharp
    and accentuated. The former is better suited to lyrical, the latter
    to dramatic poetry.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;When a Swede laughs, he still looks more serious than a Dane
    who is out of humour. In Sweden, the people are quiet, even when
    indulging in the pleasures they love best; in Denmark there is no
    pleasure without noise. In a political point of view, the
    difference between the two nations is equally marked. Beyond the
    Sound, all demonstrations are made with fierce earnestness; on this
    side of it, satire and wit are the weapons employed. On the one
    hand shells and heavy artillery, on the other, light and brilliant
    rockets. The Swedes have much liberty of the press and very little
    humour; the Danes have a great deal of humour and small liberty of
    the press. As a people, the former are of a choleric and melancholy
    temperament, the latter of a sanguine and phlegmatic one.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Whilst the Swedish national hatred is directed against
    Russia, that of Denmark takes England for its object. Finland and
    the fleet are not yet forgotten.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The Swede is constantly taking off his hat; the Dane always
    shakes hands. The former is courteous and sly, the latter simple
    and honest.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;If Denmark has little similarity with its northern neighbour,
    neither has it any marked point of resemblance with its southern
    one. It always reminds me of the <i>tongue</i> of a balance,
    vibrating between Sweden and Germany, and inclining ever to that
    side on which the greatest weight lies. Thus its literary tendency
    is German, its political one Swedish.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The best comparison that can be made of Denmark is with
    Italy; and to me, although I shall probably surprise the reader by
    saying so, Copenhagen appears like a part of Rome transplanted into
    the north. In some degree, perhaps, Thorwaldsen is answerable for
    this impression; for where he works and creates, one is apt to
    fancy oneself surrounded by that warm southern atmosphere in which
    nature and art best flourish. When he returned to Copenhagen, it
    was a festival day for the whole population of the city. A crew of
    gaily dressed sailors rowed him to land, and whilst they were doing
    so, a rainbow suddenly appeared in the heavens. The multitude
    assembled on the shore set up a shout of jubilation, to see that
    the sky itself assumed its brightest tints, to celebrate the return
    of their favourite.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;I had been told that I should not see Thorwaldsen, because he
    was staying with the Countess Stampe. This lady is about forty
    years of age, and possesses that blooming <i>embonpoint</i> which
    makes up in some women for the loss of youthful freshness. She
    became acquainted with the artist in Italy, and fascinated him to
    such a degree that he made her a present of the whole of his
    drawings, which are of immense artistical value. She excited much
    ill-will by accepting them, but at the same time it must in justice
    be owned, that Thorwaldsen is under great obligations to her. He
    had hardly arrived in Copenhagen, when innumerable invitations to
    breakfasts, dinners, and suppers were poured upon him. Every body
    wanted to have him; and, as he was known to love good living, the
    most sumptuous repasts were prepared for him. The sturdy old man,
    who had never been <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id=
    "Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> ill in his life, became pale and
    sickly, lost his taste for work, and was in a fair way to die of an
    indigestion, when the Countess Stampe stepped in to the rescue,
    carried him off to her country-seat, and there fitted him up a
    studio. His health speedily returned, and with it the energy for
    which he has always been remarkable, and he joyfully resumed the
    chisel and modelling stick.
  </div><br />

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;I had scarcely set foot in the streets of Copenhagen, when I
    saw Thorwaldsen coming towards me. I was sure that I was not
    mistaken, for no one who has ever looked upon that fine benevolent
    countenance, that long silver hair, clear, high forehead and gently
    smiling mouth&#8212;no one who has ever gazed into those divine
    blue orbs, wherein creative power seems so sweetly to repose, could
    ever forget them again. I went up and spoke to him. He remembered
    me immediately, shook my hand with that captivating joviality of
    manner which is peculiar to him, and invited me into his house. He
    inhabits the Charlottenburg, an old chateau on the KÃ¶nigsneumarkt,
    by crossing the inner court of which one reaches his studio. My
    most delightful moments in Copenhagen were passed there, looking on
    whilst he worked at the statues of deities and heroes&#8212;he
    himself more illustrious than them all. There they stand, those
    lifelike and immortal groups, displaying the most wonderful variety
    of form and attitude, and yet, strange to say, Thorwaldsen scarcely
    ever makes use of a model. His most recently commenced works were
    two gigantic allegorical figures, Samson and Ã†sculapius. The first
    was already completed, and I myself saw the bearded physiognomy of
    Ã†sculapius growing each day more distinct and perfect beneath the
    cunning hand of the master. The statues represent Strength and
    Health.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>In his house, and as a private individual, Thorwaldsen is as
  amiable and estimable as in his studio. In the centre of one of his
  rooms is a four-sided sofa, which was embroidered expressly for him
  by the fair hands of the Copenhagen ladies. The walls are covered
  with pictures, some of them very good, others of a less degree of
  merit. They were not all bought on account of their excellence;
  Thorwaldsen purchased many of them to assist young artists who were
  living, poor and in difficulties, at Rome. Dressed in his blue linen
  blouse, he explained to his visitor the subjects of these pictures,
  without the slightest tinge of vanity in his manner or words. None of
  the dignities or honours that have been showered upon him, have in
  the slightest degree turned his head. Affable, cheerful, and
  even-tempered, he appears to have preserved, to his present age of
  sixty, much of the joyous lightheartedness of youth. With great glee
  he related to Mr Boas the trick he had played the architects of the
  church of Our Lady at Copenhagen.</p>

  <p>&quot;Architects are obstinate people,&quot; said he, &quot;and
  one must know how to manage them. Thank God, that is a knowledge
  which I possess in a tolerable degree. When the church of Our Lady
  was built, the architect left six niches on either side of the
  interior, and these were to contain the twelve apostles. In vain did
  I represent to them that statues were meant to be looked at on all
  sides, and that nobody could see through a stone wall; I implored, I
  coaxed them, it was all in vain. Then thought I to myself, he is best
  served who serves himself, and thereupon I made the statues a good
  half-foot higher than the niches. You should have seen the length of
  the architects&#39; faces when they found this out. But they could
  not help themselves; the infernal sentry-boxes were bricked up, and
  my apostles stand out upon their pedestals, as you may have seen when
  you visited the church.&quot;</p>

  <p>Thorwaldsen is devotedly attached to Copenhagen, and has made a
  present to the city of all his works and collections, upon condition
  that a fitting locality should be prepared for their reception, and
  that the museum should bear his name. The king gave a wing of the
  Christiansburg for this purpose, the call for subscriptions was
  enthusiastically responded to, and the building is now well advanced.
  Its style of architecture is unostentatious, and its rows of large
  windows will admit a broad decided light upon the marble groups.
  Pending its completion, the majority of the statues and pictures are
  lodged in the palace.</p>

  <p>Mr Boas appears bent upon establishing his parallel between
  Denmark and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg
  71]</a></span> Italy. He traces it in the fondness of the Danes for
  art, poetry, and music, in their gay and joyous character, and in
  their dress. He even discovers an Italian punchinello figuring in a
  Danish puppet-show; and as it was during the month of August that he
  found himself in Denmark, the weather was not such as to dispel his
  illusions.</p>

  <p>&quot;It would be erroneous,&quot; he says, &quot;to suppose that
  Danish costumes weaken or obliterate the idea of a southern region
  conveyed by this country. A Bolognese professor would not think of
  covering his head with the red cap of a Lazzarone, and Roman
  marchesas dress themselves, like Danish countesses, according to the
  <i>Journal des Modes</i>. National costumes in all countries have
  taken refuge in villages, and the peasants in the environs of
  Copenhagen have no reason to be ashamed of their garb, which is both
  showy and picturesque. The men wear round hats and dark-blue jackets,
  lined with scarlet and adorned with long glittering rows of
  bullet-shaped buttons. The women are very tasteful in their attire.
  Their dark-green gowns, with variegated borders, reach down to their
  heels, and the shoulder-strap of the closely fitting boddice is a
  band of gold lace. The chief pains are bestowed upon the head-dress,
  which is various in its fashion, sometimes composed of clear white
  stuff, with an embroidered lappet, falling down upon the neck;
  sometimes of a cap of many colours, heavily embroidered with gold,
  and having broad ribands of a red purple, which flutter over the
  shoulders. One meets every where with this original sort of costume;
  for the peasant women repair in great numbers to the festivals at the
  various towns, and in Copenhagen they are employed as nurses to the
  children of the higher classes.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;During my sojourn in the Danish capital, the weather was so
    obliging as in no way to interfere with my Cisalpine illusions. The
    sky continued a spotless dome of lapis-lazuli, out of which the sun
    beamed like a huge diamond; and if now and then a little cloud
    appeared, it was no bigger than a white dove flitting across the
    blue expanse. The days were hot, a bath in the lukewarm sea
    scarcely cooled me, and at night a soft dreamy sort of vapour
    spread itself over the earth. I only remember one single moment
    when the peculiarities of a northern climate made themselves
    obvious. It was in the evening, and I was returning with my friend
    Holst from the delightful forest-park of Friedrichsberg. The sky
    was one immense blue prairie, across which the moon was solitarily
    wandering, when suddenly the atmosphere became illuminated with a
    bright and fiery light; a large flaming meteor rushed through the
    air, and, bursting with a loud report, divided itself into a
    hundred dazzling balls of fire. These disappeared, and immediately
    afterwards a white mist seemed to rise out of the earth, and the
    stars shone more dimly than before. Over stream and meadow rolled
    the fog, in strange fantastical shapes, floating like a silver
    gauze among the tree-stems and foliage, till it gradually wove
    itself into one close and impervious veil. To such appearances as
    these must legends of elves and fairies owe their origin.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>It is something rather new for an author to introduce into his
  book a criticism of another work on the same subject. This, Mr Boas,
  who appears to be a bold man, tolerably confident in his own
  capabilities and acquirements, has done, and in a very amusing,
  although not altogether an unobjectionable manner. He must be
  sanguine, however, if he expects his readers to place implicit faith
  in his impartiality. Under the title of &quot;A Tour in the
  North,&quot; he devotes a long chapter to a bitter attack on the
  Countess Hahn-Hahn&#39;s book of that name. Here is its
  commencement:&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;A year previously to myself, Ida, Countess Hahn-Hahn, had
    visited Sweden, and the fruit of her journey was, as is infallible
    with that lady, a book. When I arrived at Stockholm, people were
    just reading it, and I found them highly indignant at the nonsense
    and misrepresentations it contains. When a German goes to Sweden he
    is received as a brother, with a warmth and heartiness which should
    make a doubly pleasing impression, if we reflect how important it
    is in our days to preserve a mutual confidence and good-will
    between nations. When meddling persons make <span class=
    'pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> the
    perfidious attempt to embitter a friendly people by scoffing and
    abuse, there should be an end to forbearance, and it becomes a duty
    to strike in with soothing words. We must show the Swedes how such
    scribblings are appreciated in Germany, lest they should think we
    take a pleasure in ridiculing what is noble and good.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>And thereupon, Mr Boas does &quot;strike in,&quot; as he calls it;
  but however soothing his words may prove to his ill-used Swedish
  friends, we have considerable doubts as to their emollient effect
  upon the Countess, supposing always that she condescends to read
  them. He hits that lady some very hard knocks, not all of them,
  perhaps, entirely undeserved; makes out an excellent case for the
  Swedes, and proves, much more satisfactorily to himself than to us,
  that Madame Hahn-Hahn is of a very inferior grade of bookmaking
  tourists.</p>

  <p>&quot;In the first place&quot; he says, &quot;I declare that her
  work on Sweden is no original, but a dull imitation of Gustavus
  Nicolai&#39;s notorious book, &#39;Italy, as it really is.&#39; Like
  that author, the Countess labours assiduously to collect together all
  the darkest shades and least favourable points of the country and
  people she visits; exaggerates them when she finds them, and invents
  them when she does not. For the beauties of the country she has
  neither eye nor feeling; she intentionally avoids speaking of them,
  and her book is meant, like that of Nicolai, to operate as a warning,
  and scare away travellers. The good lady says this very explicitly.
  &#39;Travellers are beginning to turn their attention a good deal to
  the north, for the south is becoming insufficient to gratify that
  universal rage for rambling, with which I myself, as a true child of
  the century, am also infected. But the north is so little
  known&#8212;I, for my part, only knew it through Dahl&#39;s poetical
  landscapes&#8212;that one feels involuntarily disposed to deck it
  with the colours of the south, because the south is beautiful, and
  the north is said also to be so. Thus one is apt to set out with a
  delusion, and I think it will therefore be an act of kindness to
  those who may visit Sweden after me, if I say exactly how I found
  it.&#39; Uncommonly good, Gustavus the second. But it would be unfair
  to Nicolai to assert that his book is as dull and nonsensical as that
  of the Countess Hahn-Hahn. He went to Italy with the idea that it
  never rained there, and that oranges grew on the hedges, as sloes do
  with us. This was childish, and one could not help laughing at it.
  But when his imitatress perpetually laments and complains, because on
  the Maeler lake, under the 59th degree of latitude, she does not find
  the sultry southern climate&#8212;it becomes worse than childish, and
  one is compelled to pity her. The Countess chanced to hit upon a cool
  rainy month for her visit&#8212;I am wrong, she was not a month in
  Scandinavia altogether&#8212;and thereupon she cries out as if she
  were drowning, and despises both country and people.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is easy to understand that there can be little sympathy between
  the Countess Hahn-Hahn, an imaginative and somewhat capricious fine
  lady, with strong aristocratic and exclusive tendencies, and such a
  matter-of-fact person as Mr Boas, who, in spite of his
  sentimentality, which is a sort of national infirmity, and although
  he informs us in one part of his book that he is a poet, leans much
  more to the practical and positive than to the imaginative and
  dreamy, and we moreover suspect is a bit of a democrat. Having,
  however, taken the Countess <i>en grippe</i>, as the French call it,
  he shows her no mercy, and, it must be owned, displays some
  cleverness in hitting off and illustrating the weak points of her
  character and writings.</p>

  <p>&quot;Hardly,&quot; he resumes, &quot;has the female Nicolai
  reached Stockholm, when she begins with her insipid comparisons.
  &#39;The golden brilliancy of Naples and the magic spell of Venice
  are here entirely wanting.&#39; Is it possible? Only see what
  striking remarks this witty and travelled dame does make! In the next
  page she says:&#8212;&#39;Upon this very day, exactly one year since,
  I was in Barcelona; but here there is nothing that will bear
  comparison with the land of the aloe and the orange. Three years ago
  I was on the Lake of Como, in that fairy garden beyond the Alps! Five
  years ago in Vienna, amongst the rose-groves of Laxenburg;&#39;
  &amp;c. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg
  73]</a></span> Who cares in what places the Countess has been? Surely
  it is enough that she has written long wearisome books about them.
  Every possible corner of Italy, Spain, and Switzerland is dragged
  laboriously in, to furnish forth comparisons; and soon, no doubt, a
  similar use will be made of Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia. These
  comparisons are invariably shown to be to the disadvantage of Sweden;
  and although the lady is oftentimes compelled to confess to the
  beauty of a Swedish landscape, she never forgets to qualify the
  admission, by observing how much more beautiful such or such a place
  was. For example, she is standing one night at her window, looking
  out on the Maeler lake. &#39;I wrapped my mantilla shiveringly around
  me, stepped back from the window, shut it, and said with a slight
  sigh: In Venice the moonlight nights were very different.&#39; Really
  this would be hardly credible, did any other than a countess assure
  us of it.&quot;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Every thing in Sweden is disagreeable and adverse to her;
    roads, houses, food, people, and money; rocks, trees, rivers and
    flowers; but especially sun, sky, and air. She talks without
    ceasing of heavy clouds and pouring rains, but even this abundance
    of water is insufficient to mitigate the dryness of her book.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>&quot;I am always sorry,&quot; says a witty French writer,
  &quot;when a woman becomes an author: I would much rather she
  remained a woman.&quot; Does Mr Boas, perchance, partake this implied
  opinion, that authorship unsexes; and is it therefore that he allows
  himself to deal out such hard measure to the Countess Ida? Even if we
  agreed with his criticisms, we should quarrel with his want of
  gallantry. But it is tolerably evident that if Madame Hahn-Hahn,
  finding herself on the shores of the Baltic, in a July that might
  have answered to December in the sunny climes she had so recently
  left, allowed her account of Swedes and Sweden to be shaded a little
  <i>en noir</i> by her own physical discomforts; it is evident, we
  say, that on the other hand, our present author, either more favoured
  by the season, or less susceptible of its influence, sins equally in
  the contrary extreme, and throws a rosy tint over all that he
  portrays. Though equally likely to induce into error, it is the
  pleasanter fault to those persons who merely read the tour for
  amusement, without proposing to follow in the footsteps of the
  tourist. Your complaining, grumbling travellers are bores, whether on
  paper or in a post-chaise; and, truth to tell, we have noticed in
  others of the Countess&#39;s books a disposition to look on the dark
  side of things. But this is not always the case, and, when she gets
  on congenial ground, she shines forth as a writer of a very high
  order. Witness her Italian tour, and her book upon Turkey and Syria,
  with which latter, English readers have recently been made acquainted
  through an admirable translation, by the accomplished author of
  <i>Caleb Stukely</i>. She has her little conceits, and her little
  fancies; rather an overweening pride of caste, and contempt for the
  plebeian multitude, and an addiction to filling too many pages of her
  books with small personal and egotistical details about herself, and
  her sensations, and what dresses she wears, and how thin she is, and
  so on. But with all her faults, she is unquestionably a very
  accomplished and clever writer. Her criticisms on subjects relating
  to art, and especially her original and sparkling remarks on painting
  and architecture, although qualified by Mr Boas as twaddle, stamp her
  at once as a woman of no common order. She has profound and poetical
  conceptions of Beauty, and at times a felicity of expression in
  presenting the effects of nature and art upon her own mind, that
  strikes and startles by its novelty and power. As a delineator of men
  and manners, she is remarkable for shrewdness, subtle perception, and
  truthfulness that cannot be mistaken. Should our readers doubt our
  statements, or haply Mr Boas turn up his nose at the eulogium, we
  would simply refer them and him to the last work that has fallen from
  her pen, the Letters from the Orient, and bid them open it at the
  page which brings them to a Bedouin encampment&#8212;a scene
  described with the vigour that belongs to a masculine understanding,
  and all the fascination which a feminine mind can bestow.</p>

  <p>Still we are free to confess that the Countess has written perhaps
  rather <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
  74]</a></span> too much for the time she has been about it, and thus
  laid herself open to an accusation of bookmaking, the prevailing vice
  of the present race of authors. The incorrigible and merciless Mr
  Boas does not let this pass.</p>

  <p>&quot;The question now remains to be asked,&quot; says he;
  &quot;Why did Ida Hahn-Hahn, upon leaving a country in which she had
  passed a couple of weeks&#8212;a country of the language of which she
  confesses herself ignorant, and with which she was in every respect
  thoroughly displeased, deem it incumbent on her forthwith to write a
  thick book concerning it? The answer is this: her pretended impulse
  to authorship is merely feigned, otherwise she would not have
  troubled herself any further about such a wearisome country as
  Sweden. Through three hundred and fifty pages does she drag herself,
  grumbling as she goes; a single day must often fill a score of pages,
  for travelling costs money, and the <i>honorarium</i> is not to be
  despised. If I thus accuse the Countess of bookmaking, I also feel
  that such an accusation should be supported by abundant proof, and
  such proof am I ready to give.&quot;</p>

  <p>Oh fye, Boas! How can you be so ruthless? Besides the impolicy of
  exposing the tricks of your trade, all this is very spiteful indeed.
  You would almost tempt us, were it worth while, to take up the
  cudgels in earnest in defence of the calumniated Countess, and to
  give you a crack on the pate, which, as Maga is regularly translated
  into German for the benefit and improvement of your countrymen, would
  entirely finish your career, whether as poet, tour-writer, or any
  thing else. But seeing that your conceits and lucubrations have
  afforded us one or two good laughs, and considering, moreover, that
  you are of the number of those small fry with which it is almost
  condescension for us to meddle, we will let you off, and close this
  notice of your book, if not with entire approbation, at least with a
  moderate meed of praise.</p>

  <p>&quot;Change of air! change of air!&quot; Every body was in the
  same story. &quot;Medicine is of no use,&quot; said the doctor;
  &quot;a little change of scene will set all to rights again.&quot; I
  looked in the child&#39;s face&#8212;she was certainly very pale.
  &quot;And how long do you think she should stay away from home?&quot;
  &quot;Two or three months will stock her with health for a whole
  year.&quot; Two or three months!&#8212;oh, what a century of time
  that is, now that we have railroads all over the world, and steam to
  the Pyramids&#8212;where in all the wide earth are we to go? So we
  got maps of all countries, and took advice from every one we saw. We
  shall certainly go among hills, wherever we go; beautiful scenery if
  we can&#8212;but hills and fresh air at all events. We heard of fine
  open downs, and an occasional tempest, in the neighbourhood of Rouen.
  A steamer goes from Portsmouth to Havre, and another delightful
  little river-boat up the Seine. For a whole day we had determined on
  a visit to the burial-place of William the Norman&#8212;the
  death-place of Joan of Arc; we had devised little tours and detours
  all over the mysterious land that sent forth the conquerors of
  England; but soon there cane &quot;a frost, a nipping
  frost,&quot;&#8212;are we to be boxed up in an hotel in a French town
  the whole time? No, we must go somewhere, where we can get a
  country-house&#8212;a place on the swelling side of some romantic
  hill, where we can trot about all day upon ponies, or ramble through
  fields and meadows at our own sweet will. So we gave up all thoughts
  of Rouen. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what, sir,&quot; said a
  sympathizing neighbour: &quot;when I came home on my three years&#39;
  leave, I left the prettiest thing you ever saw, a perfect paradise,
  and a bungalow that was the envy of every man in the district.&quot;
  &quot;Well?&quot; I said with an enquiring look. &quot;It&#39;s among
  the Neilgherries; and as for bracing air, there isn&#39;t such a
  place in the whole world. I merely mention it, you know; it&#39;s a
  little too far off, perhaps; but if <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> you like it, it is quite at
  your service, I assure you.&quot; It was very tempting, but three
  months was scarcely long enough. So we were at a nonplus. Scotland we
  thought of; and the Cumberland lakes; and the Malvern hills; and the
  Peak of Derbyshire; and where we might finally have fixed can never
  be known, for our plans were decided by the advice of a friend, which
  was rendered irresistible by being backed by his own experience.
  &quot;Go to Wales,&quot; he said. &quot;I lived in such a beautiful
  place there three or four years ago&#8212;in the Vale of
  Glasbury&#8212;a lovely open space, with hills all round
  it&#8212;admirable accommodation at the Three Cocks, and the most
  civil and obliging landlord that ever offered good entertainment for
  man and beast.&quot; Out came the maps again; the route was carefully
  studied; and one day at the end of May, we found ourselves, eight
  people in all, viz., four children and two maids, in a railway coach
  at Gosport, fizzing up to Basingstoke. There is such a feeling of
  life and earnestness about a railway carriage;&#8212;the perpetual
  shake, and the continual swing, swing, on and on, without a
  moment&#39;s pause, with the quick, bustling, breathless sort of
  tramp of the engine&#8212;all these things, and forty others, put me
  in such a state of intense activity that I felt as if I kept a
  shop&#8212;or was a prodigious man upon &#39;Change&#8212;or was
  flying up to make a fortune&#8212;or had suddenly been called to form
  an administration&#8212;or had become a member of the prize ring, and
  was going up to fight white-headed Bob. However, on this occasion I
  was not called upon either to overthrow white-headed Bob of the ring,
  or long-headed Bob of the administration; and at Basingstoke we
  suddenly found ourselves, bag and baggage, wife, maids, and children,
  standing in a forlorn and disconsolate manner, at the door of the
  station-house; while the train pursued its course, and had already
  disappeared like a dream, or rather like a nightmare. There were at
  least half-a-dozen little carriages, each with one horse; and the
  drivers had, each and all of then, the audacity to offer to convey
  us&#8212;luggage and all&#8212;sixteen miles across, to Reading. Why,
  there was not a vehicle there that would have held the two trunks;
  and as to conveying us all, it would have taken the united energies
  of all the Flies in Basingstoke, with the help of the Industrious
  Fleas to boot, to get us to our destination within a week. While in
  this perplexing situation, wondering what people could possibly want
  with such an array of boxes and bags, a quiet-looking man, who had
  stood by, chewing the lash of a driving-whip in a very philosophical
  manner, said, &quot;Please sir, I&#39;ll take you all.&quot; &quot;My
  good friend, have you seen the whole party?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, sir,
  I brought a bigger nor yourn for this here train&#8212;we have a fly
  on purpose.&quot; What a sensible man he must have been who devised a
  vehicle so much required by unhappy sires that are ordered to remove
  their Lares for change of air! &quot;Bring round the ark,&quot; we
  cried; and in a minute came two very handsome horses to the door,
  drawing a thing that was an aggravated likeness of the old hackney
  coaches, with a slight cross of an omnibus in its breed. It held
  seven inside with perfect ease, and would have held as many more as
  might be required; and it carried all the luggage on the top with an
  air of as much ease as if it had only been a bonnet, and it was
  rather proud than otherwise of its head-dress. The driving seat was
  as capacious as the other parts of the machine, and we had much
  interesting conversation with the Jehu&#8212;whose epithets, we are
  sorry to say, as applied to railroads, were of that class of
  adjectives called the emphatic. There is to be a cross line very
  shortly between Basingstoke and Reading, uniting the South-Western
  and Great Western Railways&#8212;and then, what is to become of the
  tremendous vehicle and its driver? The coach, to be sure, may be
  retained as a specimen of Brobdignaggian fly, but my friend Jehu must
  appear in the character of Othello, and confess that &quot;his
  occupation&#39;s gone.&quot; Thank heaven! people wear boots, and
  many of them like to have them cleaned, so, with the help of Day and
  Martin, you may live. &quot;That&#39;s the Duke&#39;s gate,
  sir,&quot; he said, pointing with his whip to a plain lodge and
  entrance on the left hand. &quot;The lodge-keeper was his top groom
  at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg
  76]</a></span> the time Waterloo was&#8212;and a very nice place he
  has.&quot; This was Strathfieldsaye: there were miles and miles of
  the most beautiful plantations, all the fences in excellent order,
  the cottages along the road clean and comfortable, and every symptom
  of a good landlord to be seen as far as the eye could reach.</p>

  <p>&quot;If it wasn&#39;t for all this here luggage,&quot; said Jehu
  in a confidential whisper, with a backward jerk of his head towards
  the moving pyramid behind us; &quot;we might go through the park. The
  Duke gives permission to gentlemen&#39;s carriages.&quot;</p>

  <p>So the poor man deluded himself with the thought, that if it
  wer&#39;n&#39;t for the bandboxes, we might pass muster as fresh from
  the hands of Cork and Spain.</p>

  <p>&quot;That&#39;s very kind of the Duke.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, he&#39;s the best of gentlemen&#8212;I hears the best of
  characters of him from his tenants, and all the poor folks round
  about.&quot; Now here was our driver&#8212;rather ragged than
  otherwise, and as poor as need be&#8212;bearing evidence to the
  character of the greatest man in these degenerate days, on points
  that are perhaps more important than some that will be dwelt on by
  his biographers. The best of characters from his tenants and the
  poor;&#8212;well, glorious Duke, I shall always think of this when I
  read about your victories, and all your great doings in peace and
  war; and when people call you the Iron Duke, and the great soldier,
  and the hero of Waterloo, I shall think of you as the hero of
  Strathfieldsaye, and the best of characters among your tenants and
  the poor folks round about.</p>

  <p>&quot;Does the Duke often come to Reading?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No; very seldom.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I should have thought he would come by the Great Western,
  and drive across.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He!&quot; exclaimed the driver, giving a cut to the near
  horse by way of italicising his observation. &quot;He never comes by
  none of their rails. He don&#39;t like &#39;em. He posts every step
  of the way. He&#39;s a reg&#39;lar gentleman, he is, the
  Duke.&quot;</p>

  <p>And in the midst of conversation like this, we got to Reading.
  Through some wretched streets we drove, and then through some
  tolerable ones; and at last pulled up at the Great Western Hotel, a
  large handsome house, very near the Railway station; and in a few
  minutes were as comfortably settled as if we had travelled with a
  couple of outriders, and had ordered our rooms for a month. The
  sitting-room had three or four windows, of which two looked out upon
  the terminus. At these the whole party were soon happily stationed,
  watching the different trains that came sweeping up and down every
  few minutes; long luggage trains, pursuing their heavy way with a
  business-like solidity worthy of their great weight and
  respectability; short dapper trains, that seemed to take a spurt up
  the road as if to try their wind and condition; and occasionally a
  mysterious engine, squeaking, and hissing, and roaring, and then,
  with a succession of curious jumps and pantings, backing itself half
  a mile or so down the course, and then spluttering and dashing out of
  sight as if madly intent upon suicide, and in search of a stone wall
  to run its head upon. As to feeling surprise at the number of
  accidents, the only wonder a sensible man can entertain on the
  subject is, that there is any thing but accidents from morning to
  night. And yet, when you look a little closer into it, every thing
  seems so admirably managed, that the chances are thousands to one
  against any misfortune occurring. Every engine seems to know its
  place as accurately as a cavalry charger; the language also of the
  signals seems very intelligible to the iron ears of the Lucifers and
  Beelzebubs, and the other evil spirits, who seem on every line to be
  the active agents of locomotion. Why can&#39;t the directors have
  more Christianlike names for their moving power? What connexion is
  there between a beautiful new engine, shining in all its
  finery&#8212;the personification of obedient and beneficent
  strength&#8212;with the &quot;Infernal,&quot; or the
  &quot;Phlegethon,&quot; or the &quot;Styx?&quot; Are they aware what
  a disagreeable association of ideas is produced in the students of
  LempriÃ¨re&#39;s classical dictionary by the two last names? or the
  Charon or Atropos? Let these things be mended, and let them be called
  by some <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
  77]</a></span> more inviting appellations&#8212;Nelson, St Vincent,
  Rodney, Watt, Arkwright, Stephenson, Milton, Shakspeare,
  Scott;&#8212;but leave heathen mythology and diabolic geography
  alone. As night began to close, the sights and sounds grew more
  strange and awful. A great flaming eye made its appearance at a
  distance; the gradual boom of its approach grew louder and louder,
  and its look became redder and redder; and then we watched it roll
  off into the darkness again, on the other side of the station, on its
  way to Bath&#8212;till, tearing up at the rate of forty miles an
  hour, came another red-eyed monster, breathing horrible flame, and
  seeming to burn its way through the sable livery of the night with
  the strength and straightness of a red-hot cannon-ball. And then we
  called for candles and went to bed.</p>

  <p>The train was to pass on its way to Bristol at half-past eleven,
  so we had plenty of time to see the lions of Reading&#8212;if there
  had been any animals of the kind in the neighbourhood&#8212;but after
  a short detour in the street, and a glimpse into the country, we
  found ourselves irresistibly attracted to the railway. The scene here
  was the same as on the previous night, and we were more and more
  confirmed in our opinion, that, next to the sea or a navigable river,
  a railway is the pleasantest object in a rural view. As to the
  impostors who extort thousands of pounds from the unhappy
  shareholders, on the pretext that the line will be injurious to their
  estates, they ought at once to be sent to Brixton for obtaining money
  under false pretences. It gives a greatly increased value to their
  lands, as may be seen by the superior rents they can obtain for the
  farms along the line; and as to the picturesqueness of the landscape,
  it is only because the eye is not yet accustomed to it, nor the mind
  embued with railway associations, that it is not considered a finer
  &quot;object&quot; than the level greenery of a park, or the
  hedgerows of a cultivated farm. Painters have already begun to see
  the grandeur of a tempestuous sea ridden over by steamers; and before
  the end of the next war, some black &quot;queller of the ocean
  flood,&quot; with short funnel and smoke-blackened sails, will be
  thought as fit a theme for poetry and romance, as the Victory or the
  Shannon.</p>

  <p>Knowledge, which we are every where told is now advancing at
  railway speed, is still confined within very narrow limits, we are
  sorry to say, among railway clerks and other officials. They still
  seem to measure the sphere of their studies by distance, and not by
  time; for instance, not one of the <i>employÃ©s</i> at Reading could
  give us more information about Bristol than if it had been three
  days&#39; journey removed from him. Three hours conveys us from one
  to the other&#8212;and yet they did not know the name or situation of
  a single inn, nor where the boats to Chepstow sailed from, nor
  whether there were any boats to Chepstow at all. In ancient times
  such ignorance might be excusable, when the towns were really as
  distant as London and York now are; but when three hours is the
  utmost limit, and every half hour the communication is kept up
  between them, it struck us as something unaccountable that Bristol
  should be such a complete <i>terra incognita</i> to at least a dozen
  smart-looking individuals, who stamp off the tickets, and chuck the
  money into a drawer, with an easy negligence very gratifying to the
  beholder. Remembering the recommendation of the Royal Western Hotel
  given us by a friend, with the whispered information that the turtle
  was inimitable, and only three-and-sixpence a basin; we stowed away
  the greater portion of the party in a first-class carriage, and
  betook ourselves in economical seclusion to a vehicle of the second
  rank. And a first-rate vehicle it was&#8212;better in the absence of
  stuffing on that warm day, than its more aristocratic companion; and
  in less than three minutes we were all spinning down the road&#8212;a
  line of human and other baggage, at least a quarter of a mile in
  length.</p>

  <p>At Swindon we were allowed ten minutes for refreshment. The great
  lunching-room is a very splendid apartment&#8212;and hungry
  passengers rushed in at both doors, and in a moment clustered round
  the counters, and were busy in the demolition of pies and sandwiches.
  Under a noble arch the counters are placed; the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
  attendants occupying a space between them, so that one set attend to
  the gormandizers who enter by one of the doors, and the rest on the
  others. It has exactly the effect of a majestic mirror&#8212;and so
  completely was this my impression, that it was with the utmost
  difficulty I persuaded myself that the crowd on the other side of the
  arch was not the reflection of the company upon this. Exactly
  opposite the place where I stood&#8212;in the act of enjoying a glass
  of sherry and a biscuit&#8212;I discovered what I took of course to
  be the counterfeit presentment of myself. What an extraordinary
  mirror, I thought!&#8212;for I saw a prodigious man, with enormous
  whiskers, ramming a large veal pie into his mouth with one hand, and
  holding in the other a tumbler of porter. I looked at the glass of
  sherry, and gave the biscuit a more vigorous bite&#8212;alas! it had
  none of the flavour of the veal and porter; so I discovered that the
  law of optics was unchanged, and that I had escaped the infliction of
  so voracious a double-ganger.</p>

  <p>The country round Chippenham is as beautiful as can be conceived;
  all the fruit-trees were in full blossom, and we swept through long
  tracts of the richest and prettiest orchards we ever saw. Hall and
  farm, and moated grange, passed in rapid succession; and at last the
  fair city of Bath rose like the queen of all the land, and looked
  down from her palaces and towers on the fairest champaign that ever
  queen looked upon before. Seen from the railway, the upper part of
  the town seems to rise up from the very midst of orchards and
  gardens; terrace above terrace, but still with a great flush of
  foliage between; it is a pity it ever grew into a fashionable
  watering-place; though, even now, it is not too late to amend. Like
  some cynosure of neighbouring eyes, fed from her gentle youth upon
  all the sights and sounds of rural life, she is too beautiful to put
  on the airs and graces of a belle of the court. Let her go back to
  her country ways&#8212;her walks in the village lanes&#8212;her
  scampers across the fields; she will be more really captivating than
  if she was redolent of Park Lane, and never missed a drawing-room or
  Almack&#39;s. But here we are at Bristol, and must leave our
  exhortations to Bath to a future opportunity.</p>

  <p>It is amazing how rapidly the passengers disperse. By the time our
  trunks and boxes were all collected, the station was deserted, the
  empty carriages had wheeled themselves away, and we began to have
  involuntary reminiscences of Campbell&#39;s <i>Last Man</i>.
  Earth&#39;s cities had no sound nor tread&#8212;so it was with no
  slight gratification that we beheld the cad of an omnibus beckoning
  us to take our place on the outside of his buss. The luggage had been
  swung down in a lump through a hole in the floor, and by the time we
  reached the same level, by the periphrasis of a stair, every thing
  had been stowed away on the roof, where in a few moments we joined
  it; and careered through the streets of Bristol, for the first time
  in our lives. &quot;Do you go to any hotel near the quay where the
  Chepstow steamers start from?&quot; was our first enquiry; but before
  the charioteer had time to remove the tobacco from his cheek, to let
  forth the words of song, a gentleman who sat behind us very kindly
  interfered. &quot;The York Hotel, sir, is quite near the river, in a
  nice quiet square, and the most comfortable house I ever was in. If
  they can give you accommodation, you can&#39;t be in better
  quarters.&quot; Next to the praiseworthiness of a good Samaritan, who
  takes care of the houseless and the stranger, is the merit of the
  benevolent individual who tells you the good Samaritan&#39;s address.
  We made up our minds at once to go on to the York Hotel.</p>

  <p>&quot;For Chepstow, sir?&quot; said the stranger&#8212;&quot;a
  beautiful place, but by no means equal to Linton in North Devon. Do
  you go to Chepstow straight?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;As soon as a boat will take us: we are going into Wales for
  change of air, and the sooner we get there the better.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Change of air!&#8212;there isn&#39;t such air in England,
  no, nor anywhere else, as at Linton. Why don&#39;t you come to
  Linton? You can get there in six hours.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But Welsh air is the one recommended.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nonsense. There&#39;s no air in Wales to be compared with
  Linton. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg
  79]</a></span> I&#39;ve tried them both&#8212;so have hundreds of
  other people&#8212;and as for beauty and scenery, and walks and
  drives, Linton beats the whole world.&quot; All this was very
  difficult to resist; but we set our minds firmly on the Three Cocks
  and Glasbury vale, and repelled all the temptations of the gem of the
  North of Devon. Every hour that took us nearer to our goal, brought
  out the likeness we had formed of it in our hearts with greater
  relief. A fine secluded farm&#8212;of which a few rooms were fitted
  up as a house of entertainment&#8212;a wild hill rising gradually at
  its back&#8212;a mountain-stream rattling and foaming in
  front&#8212;all round it, swelling knolls and heathy mountains. What
  had Linton to show in opposition to charms like these? We rejected
  the advice of our good-natured counsellor with great regret, more
  especially as a sojourn in Linton would probably have enabled us to
  cultivate his further acquaintance. The York was found all that he
  described&#8212;clean, quiet, and comfortable. When the young fry had
  finished their dinner, away we all set on a voyage of discovery to
  Clifton. Up a hill we climbed&#8212;which in many neighbourhoods
  would be thought a mountain&#8212;and passed paragons, and circuses,
  and crescents, on left and right, wondering when we were ever to
  emerge into the open air. At last we reached the top&#8212;a green
  elevation surrounded on two sides by streets and villas&#8212;crowned
  with a curious-looking observatory, and ornamented at one end with a
  strange building on the very edge of the cliff; being one of the
  <i>termini</i> of the suspension bridge, which got thus far, and no
  further. Going across the Green, the sight is the most grand and
  striking we ever saw. Far down, skirting its way round cliffs of
  prodigious height&#8212;which, however, except when they are quarried
  for building purposes, are covered with the richest
  foliage&#8212;along their whole descent winds the Avon, at that
  moment in full tide, and covered in all its windings with sails of
  every shape and hue. The rocks on the opposite side are of a glorious
  rich red, and consort most beautifully with the green leaves of the
  plantations that soften their rugged precipices, by festooning them
  to the very brink. Then there are wild dells running back in the
  wooded parts of the hill, and walks seem to be made through them for
  the convenience of maids who love the moon&#8212;or more probably,
  and more poetically too, for the refreshment of the toiling citizens
  of the smoky town, who wander about among these sylvan recesses, with
  their wives and families, and enjoy the wondrous beauty of the
  landscape, without having consulted Burke or Adam Smith on the causes
  of their delight. As you climb upwards towards the observatory, you
  fancy you are attending one of Buckland&#39;s lectures&#8212;the
  whole language you hear is geological and philosophic. About a dozen
  men, with little tables before them, are dispersed over the latter
  part of the ascent, and keep tempting you with &quot;fossiliferous
  specimens of the oolite formation,&quot; &quot;tertiary,&quot;
  &quot;silurian,&quot; &quot;saurian,&quot;
  &quot;stratification,&quot; &quot;carboniferous.&quot; It was quite
  wonderful to hear such a stream of learning, and to see, at the same
  time, the vigour of these terrene philosophers in polishing their
  specimens upon a whetstone, laid upon their knees. A few shillings
  put us all in possession of memorials of Clifton, in the shape of
  little slabs of different strata, polished on both sides, and
  ingeniously moulded to resemble a book. A little further up, we got
  besieged by another body of the Clifton Samaritans, the proprietors
  of a troop of donkeys, all saddled and bridled in battle array. Into
  the hands of a venerable matron, the owner of a vast number of
  donkies, and two or three ragged urchins, who acted as the Widdicombs
  of the cavalcade, we committed all the younkers for an hour&#39;s
  joy, between the turnpike and back, and betook ourselves to a seat at
  the ledge of the cliff, and &quot;gazed with ever new delight&quot;
  at the noble landscape literally at our feet. But the hour quickly
  passed; the donkeys resigned their load; and we slid, as safely as
  could be expected, down the inclined plane that conducted us to the
  York. We did not experiment upon the turtle-soup, as we had been
  advised to do at the Royal Western, but some Bristol salmon did as
  well; and after a long consultation about boats, and breakfast at an
  early hour, we found we had got through <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> our day,
  and that hitherto the journey had offered nothing but enjoyment.</p>

  <p>The morning lowered; and, heavily in clouds, but luckily without
  rain, we effected our embarkation, at eight o&#39;clock, on board the
  Wye&#8212;a spacious steamer that plies every day, according to the
  tide, between Bristol and Chepstow. We were a numerous crew, and had
  a steady captain, with a face so weather-beaten that we concluded his
  navigation had not been confined to the Severn sea. The first two or
  three miles of our course was through the towering cliffs and wooded
  chasms we had admired from the Clifton Down. For that part of its
  career, the Avon is so beautiful, and glides along with such an
  evident aim after the picturesque, that it is difficult to believe it
  any thing but an ornamental piece of water, adding a new feature to a
  splendid landscape; and yet this meandering stream is the pathway of
  nations, and only inferior in the extent of its traffic to the Thames
  and Mersey. The shores soon sink into commonplace meadows, and we
  emerge into the Severn, which is about five miles wide, from the
  mouth of the Avon to that of the Wye. All the way across, new
  headlands open upon the view; and, far down the channel, you catch a
  glimpse of the Flat Holms, and other little islands; while in front
  the Welsh hills bound the prospect, at a considerable distance, and
  form a noble background to the rich, wooded plains of Monmouthshire,
  and the low-lying shore we are approaching. Suddenly you jut round an
  enormous rock, and find yourself in a river of still more sylvan
  gentleness than the Avon. The other passengers seemed to have no eyes
  for the picturesque&#8212;perhaps they had seen the scenery till they
  were tired of it; and some of them were more pleasantly engaged than
  gaping and gazing at rocks and trees. Grouped at the tiller-chains
  were four or five people, very happily employed in looking at each
  other&#8212;a lady and gentleman, in particular, seemed to find a
  peculiar pleasure in the occupation; and were instructing each other
  in the art and mystery of tying the sailor&#39;s knot. Time after
  time the cord refused to follow the directions of the girl&#39;s
  fingers&#8212;very white fingers they were too, and a very pretty
  girl&#8212;and, with untiring assiduity, the teacher renewed his
  lesson. We ventured a prophecy that they would soon be engaged in the
  twisting of a knot that would not be quite so easy to untie as the
  sailor&#39;s slip that made them so happy.</p>

  <p>On we went on the top of the tide, rounding promontories, and
  gliding among bosky bowers and wooded dells, till at last our panting
  conveyer panted no more, and we lay alongside the pier of Chepstow.
  The tide at this place rises to the incredible height of fifty, and
  sometimes, on great occasions, of seventy feet; so they have a
  floating sort of foot-bridge from the vessel to the shore, that sinks
  and rises with the flood, connected with the land by elongating iron
  chains, and illustrating the ups and downs of life in a very
  remarkable manner. I will not attempt to describe Chepstow on the
  present occasion, for a stay in it did not enter into our plan. The
  Three Cocks grew in interest the nearer we got to their interesting
  abode. We determined to hurry forward to Abergavenny&#8212;thence to
  send a missive of enquiry as to the accommodations of the
  hostel&#8212;to go on at once, if we could be received&#8212;and
  (leaving all the lumber, including the maids and the younger
  children) to make a series of voyages of discovery, that would
  entitle us to become members of the Travellers&#39; Club.</p>

  <p>A coach was on the strand ready to start for Monmouth; a whisper
  and half-a-crown secured the whole of the inside and two seats out,
  against all concurrents; and the Wye, the boat, the knot-tying
  passengers, were all left behind, and we began to climb the hill as
  fast as two miserable-looking horses could crawl. A leader was added
  when we had got a little way up; but as they neglected to furnish our
  coachman with a whip long enough to reach beyond his wheeler&#39;s
  ears, our unicorn pursued the even tenor of his way with very
  slackened traces, while our friend sat the picture of indignation,
  with his short <i>flagellum</i> in his hand, and implored all the
  male population who overtook us, to favour him by kicking the unhappy
  leader to death. An occasional benevolent Christian complied with his
  request to the extent of a dig with a <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> stout boot under the rib;
  but every now and then, the furibund jarvey apologised to us for the
  slowness of our course by asking&#8212;&quot;Won&#39;t I serve him
  out when I gets a whip!&quot; A whip he at last got, and made up for
  lost time by belabouring the lazy culprit in a very scientific
  manner; and having got us all into a gallop, he became quite pleasant
  and communicative. All the people in Monmouthshire are Welsh, that is
  very clear; and Monmouthshire is as Welsh a county as Carnarvon, in
  spite of the maps of geographers, and the circuits of the Judges. The
  very faces of the people are evidence of their Taffy-hood. We have
  had no experience yet if they carry out the peculiar ideas on the
  rights of property, attributed to Taffy in the ancient legend, which
  relates the method that gentleman took to supply himself with a leg
  of beef and a marrow bone; but their voices and names are redolent of
  leeks, and no Act of Parliament can ever make them English. You might
  as well pass an Act of Parliament to make our friend Joseph
  Hume&#39;s speeches English. And therefore, throughout the narrative,
  we shall always consider ourselves in Wales, till we cross the Severn
  again. We trotted round the park wall of a noble estate called
  Pearcefield, and when we had crowned the ascent, our Jehu turned
  round with an air of great exultation, pulling up his horses at the
  same time, and said&#8212;&quot;There! did you ever see a sight like
  that? This is the Double View.&quot; He might well be proud&#8212;for
  such a prospect is not to be equalled, I should think, in the world.
  The Wye is close below you, with its rich banks, frowned over by a
  magnificent crag, that forms the most conspicuous feature of the
  landscape; and in the distance is the river Severn, pursuing its
  shining way through the fertile valleys of Glo&#39;stershire, and by
  some <i>deceptio visus</i>, for which we cannot account, raised
  apparently to a great height above the level of its sister stream. It
  has the appearance of being conveyed in a vast artificially raised
  embankment, laughing into scorn the grandest aqueducts of ancient
  Rome, and bearing perhaps a greater resemblance to the lofty-bedded
  Po in its passage through the plains of Lombardy. The combination of
  the two rivers in the same scene, with the peculiar characteristics
  of each brought prominently before the eye at once, make this one of
  the finest &quot;sights&quot; that can be imagined. The driver seemed
  satisfied with the sincerity of our admiration, and, like a good
  patriot, evidently considered our encomiums as a personal compliment
  to himself. The whole of the drive to Monmouth is through a
  succession of noble views, only to be equalled, as far as our
  travelling experience extends, by the stage on the Scottish border,
  between Longtown and Langholm. But soon after this, the skies, that
  had gloomed for a long time, took fairly to pouring out all the cats
  and dogs they possessed upon our miserable heads. An umbrella on the
  top of a coach is at all times a nuisance and incumbrance, so, in
  gloomy resignation to a fate that was unavoidable, we wrapt our
  mantle round us, and made the most of a bad bargain. To Monmouth we
  got at last, and to our great discomfort found that it was
  market-day, and that we had to dispute the possession of a joint of
  meat with some wet and hungry farmers. We compromised the matter for
  a beefsteak, for which we had to wait about an hour; and having seen
  that the whole of the garrison was well supplied, we proceeded to
  make enquiries as to the best method of getting on to Abergavenny.
  Finding that information on a matter so likely to remove a
  remunerative party from the inn was not very easy to be obtained from
  the denizens thereof, we made our way into the market. The civility
  of the natives, when their interests are not concerned, is
  extraordinary; and in a moment we were recommended to the Beaufort
  Arms, a hotel that would do honour to Edinburgh itself&#8212;had
  ordered a roomy chaise, and procured the services of a man with a
  light cart, to follow us with the heavy luggage. The sky began to
  clear, the postillion trotted gaily on, and we left the county town,
  not much gratified with our experience of its smoky rooms and tough
  beefsteaks. We followed the windings of the Trothy, a stream of a
  very lively and frisky disposition, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> passing a seat of the Duke
  of Beaufort, who seems lord-paramount of the county, and at length
  came in view of the noble ruins of Ragland Castle. But now we were
  wiser than we had been at the early part of the journey, and had
  bought a very well written guide-book, by Mr W.H. Thomas, which, at
  the small outlay of one shilling, made us as learned on &quot;the
  Wye, with its associated scenery and ruins,&quot; as if we had lived
  among them all our days. Inspired by his animated pages, we descanted
  with the profoundest erudition, to our astonished companion on the
  box, about its machicolated towers, and the finely proportioned
  mullions of the hall. &quot;If you ascend the walls of the
  castle,&quot; we exclaimed in a paroxysm of enthusiasm, as if we were
  perched on the very top, &quot;you will see that the castle occupies
  the centre of an undulating plain, checkered with white-washed
  farm-houses, fields, and noble groves of oak. The tower and village
  of Rhaglan lie at a short distance, picturesquely straggling and
  irregular. To the north, the bold and diversified forms of the Craig,
  the Sugar Loaf, Skyrids, and Blorenge mountains, with the outlines of
  the Hatterals, perfect the scene in this direction; whilst the
  ever-varying and amphitheatrical boundary of this natural basin, may
  be traced over the Blaenavons, Craig-y-garayd, (close to Usk,) the
  Gaer Vawr, the round Twm Barlwm, the fir-crowned top of Wentwood
  forest, Pen-cae-Mawr, the dreary heights of Newchurch and Devauder;
  the continuation of the same range past Llanishen, the white church
  of which is plainly visible; Trelleck, Craig-y-Dorth, and the
  highlands above Troy Park, where they end.&quot; We were going on in
  the same easy and off-hand manner to describe some other
  peculiarities of the landscape, when a sudden lurch of the carriage
  brought the book we were furtively pillaging into open view, and we
  were forced, with a very bad grace, to confess our obligations to Mr
  W.H. Thomas. A very beautiful ruin it is, certainly, and we made a
  vow to devote a day to exploring its remains, and judging for
  ourselves of the accuracy of the guide-book&#39;s description. Even
  if the road had no recommendation from the lovely openings it gives
  at every turn, it would be a pleasure to travel by it in sunshine,
  for the hedges along its whole extent were a complete rampart of the
  sweetest smelling May. Such miles of snow-white blossoms we never saw
  before. It looked like Titania&#39;s bleaching-ground, and as if all
  the fairies had hung out their white frocks to dry. And the hawthorn
  blossoms along the road were emulated on all the little terraces at
  the side of it; the apple and pear trees were in full bloom, and
  every little cottage rejoiced in its orchard&#8212;so that, with the
  help of hedges and fruit trees, the whole earth was in a glow of
  beauty and perfume&#8212;and we prophecy this will be a famous year
  for cider and perry. Abergavenny has a very bad approach from
  Monmouth, and we dreaded a repetition of the delays and toughnesses
  we had just escaped from; how great therefore was our gratification
  when we pulled up at the door of the Angel, and were shown into a
  splendid room, thirty-five or forty feet long by twenty wide, secured
  bedrooms as clean and comfortable as heart could desire, and had
  every thing we asked for with the precision of clockwork and the
  rapidity of steam. The Three Cocks began to descend from the lofty
  place they held in our esteem, and we resolved for one day at least
  to rest contentedly in such comfortable quarters, and look about us;
  so forth we sallied, and in the course of our pilgrimage speedily
  arrived at Aberga&#39;ny Castle. Talk of picturesqueness! this was
  picturesque enough for poet or painter with a vengeance&#8212;great
  thick walls all covered over with ivy, crowning a round knoll at the
  upper part of the town, and looking over a finer view, we will
  venture to say, than that we have just described as seen from
  Ragland; and to complete the beauty of it&#8212;the comforts of
  modern civilization uniting themselves to ancient
  magnificence&#8212;the main walls have been fitted up by one of the
  late lords into a pretty dwelling-house, which is at this moment
  occupied by one of the surgeons of the town. This is the true use of
  an antique ruin&#8212;this is replacing the coat of mail with a
  rain-proof mackintosh&#8212;the steel casque of Brian de Boisguilbert
  with the Kilmarnock nightcap <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83"
  id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> of Bailie Nicol Jarvie. And in this
  instance the change has been effected with the greatest skill; the
  coat of mail and steel casque are still there, but only for show; the
  mackintosh and nightcap are the habitual dress: and few dwellings in
  our poor eyes are comparable to the one, that outside has the date of
  the crusaders, and inside, the conveniences of 1845. The town has a
  noble body-guard of hills all round it; and perched high up on almost
  inaccessible ledges, are little white-walled cottages, that made us
  long for the wings of a bird to fly up and inspect them closer; no
  other mode of conveyance would be either speedy or safe, for the
  sides of the mountains are nearly perpendicular, and would have put
  Douglas&#39;s horse to its mettle when he was on a visit to Owen
  Glendowr. Dark, gloomy, Tartarean hills they appear, and no wonder;
  for their whole interior is composed of iron, and day and night they
  are glimmering and smoking with a hundred fires. They have a
  dreadful, stern, metallic look about them, and are as different in
  their configuration from the chalk hills of Hampshire as <i>they</i>
  are from cheese. Some day we shall ascend their dusky sides, and dive
  into Pluto&#39;s drear domains&#8212;the iron-works&#8212;a god who,
  in the present state of railway speculation, might easily be
  confounded with Plutus; and with this and many other good
  resolutions, we returned to the hospitable care of our friend Mr
  Morgan, at the Angel. Next day was Sunday, and very wet. We slipped
  across the street and heard a very good sermon in the morning, in a
  large handsome church, which was not quite so well filled as it ought
  to have been, and were kept close prisoners all day afterwards by the
  unrelenting clouds.</p>

  <p>But our object was not yet attained, and we resolved to start off
  with fresh vigour on our expedition to the Three Cocks. It was only
  two-and-twenty miles off; our host, with none of the spirit that,
  they say, is always found between two of a trade, spoke in the
  highest terms of the Vale of Glasbury, and its clean and comfortable
  hotel. He also made enquiry for us as to its present condition, and
  brought back the pleasing intelligence that it was not full, and that
  we should find plenty of accommodation at once. This did away with
  the necessity of writing to the landlord, and in a short time we were
  once more upon the road, maids and children inside as usual, and a
  natty postilion cocking his white hat and flicking his little whip,
  in the most bumptious manner imaginable. Through Crickhowell we went
  without drawing bridle, and went almost too fast to observe
  sufficiently its very beautiful situation; past noble country-seats,
  bower and hall, we drove; and at last wound our solitary way along a
  cross-road, among some pastoral hills, that reminded us more of
  Dumfries-shire than any country we have ever seen. The road ascended
  gradually for many miles; and on crowning the elevation, we caught a
  very noble extensive view of a rich, flat, thickly-wooded plain, that
  bore a great resemblance to the unequalled neighbourhood of Warwick.
  Down and down we trotted&#8212;hills and heights of all kinds left
  behind us&#8212;trees, shrubs, hedges, all in the fullest leaf, lay
  for miles and miles on every side; and the scenery had about as much
  resemblance to our ideal of a Welsh landscape, as ditch water to
  champagne. Through this wilderness of sweets, stifling and oppressive
  from its very richness, we drove for a long way, looking in vain for
  the hilly region where the Three Cocks had taken up their abode. At
  last we saw, a little way in front of us, at the side of the
  road&#8212;or rather with one gable-end projecting into it, a large
  white house, with a mill appearing to constitute one of its wings.
  &quot;The man will surely stop here to water the horses,&quot; was
  our observation; and so indeed he did&#8212;and as he threw the rein
  loose over the off horse&#39;s neck&#8212;there! don&#39;t you see
  the sign-board on the wall? Alas, alas, this is the Three Cocks! An
  admirable fishing quarter it must be, for the river is very near, and
  the country rich and beautiful, but not adapted to our particular
  case, where mountain air and free exposure are indispensable. But if
  it had been ten times less adapted to our purpose we had travelled
  too far to give it up.</p>

  <p>&quot;Can you take us in for a few weeks?&quot;</p>

  <p>The landlord laughed at the idea. &quot;I could not find room for
  a single <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg
  84]</a></span> individual, if you gave me a thousand pounds. A party
  has been with me for some time, and I can&#39;t even say how long
  they may stay.&quot;</p>

  <p>And, corroborative of this, we saw at the window our fortunate
  extruders, who no doubt congratulated themselves on so many points of
  the law being in their favour. Here were we stuck on the Queen&#39;s
  high road&#8212;tired horses, cooped-up children&#8212;and the Three
  Cocks as unattainable as the Philosopher&#39;s stone. The
  sympathizing landlord consoled us in our disappointment as well as he
  could. The postilion jumped into his saddle again, and we pursued our
  way to the nearest place where there was any likelihood of a
  reception&#8212;namely, the Hay, a village of some size about five
  miles further on. &quot;Come along, we shall easily find a nice
  cottage to-morrow, or get into some farm-house, and ruralize for a
  month or two delightfully.&quot; Our hopes rose as we looked forward
  to a settled home, after our experience of the road for so many days;
  and we soared to such a pitch of audacity at last, that we
  congratulated ourselves that we had not got in at Glasbury, but were
  forced to go forward. The world was all before us where to choose.
  The country seemed to improve&#8212;that is, to get a little less
  Dutch in its level, as we proceeded&#8212;and we finally reached the
  Hay, with the determination of Barnaby&#39;s raven, to bear a good
  heart at all events, and take for our motto, in all the ills of life,
  &quot;Never say die!&#8212;never say die!&quot;</p>

  <p>The hotel had been taken by assault, and was occupied in great
  force by a troop of dragoons, on their march into Glo&#39;stershire.
  We therefore did not come off quite so well as if we had led the
  forlorn-hope ourselves; but, after so long a journey, we rejoiced in
  being admitted at all. Two or three Welsh girls, who perhaps would
  have been excellent waiters under other circumstances, appeared to
  consider themselves strictly on military duty, and no other; so we
  sate for a very long time in solitary stateliness, wondering when the
  water would boil, and the tea-things be brought, and the ham and eggs
  be ready. And of our wondering there was likely to be no end, till at
  last the hungry captain, the lieutenant, and the cornet, were fairly
  settled at dinner, and at about eight o&#39;clock we got tea, but no
  bread; then came the loaf&#8212;and there was no butter; then the
  butter&#8212;and there was no knife; but at last, all things arrived,
  and the little ones were sent off to bed, and we amused ourselves by
  listening to the rain on the window panes, and the whistling of the
  wind in the long passages; and, with a resolution to be up in good
  time to pursue our house-hunting project on the morrow, we concluded
  the fifth day of our peregrinations in search of change of air.</p>

  <p>We had a charming prospect from the window, at breakfast. A gutter
  tearing its riotous way down the street, supplied by a whole
  night&#39;s rain, and clouds resting with the most resolute
  countenances on the whole face of the land. At the
  post-office&#8212;that universal focus of information&#8212;to which
  we wended in one of the intervals between the showers, we were told
  of admirable lodgings. On going to see them, they consisted of two
  little rooms, in a narrow lane. Then we were sent to another quarter,
  and found the accommodation still more inadequate; and, at last, were
  inconceivably cheered, by hearing of a pretty cottage&#8212;just the
  thing&#8212;only left a short time ago by Captain somebody; five
  bed-rooms, two parlours, large garden; if it had been planned by our
  own architect, it could not have been better. Off we hurried to the
  owner of this bijou. The worthy captain, on giving up his lease, had
  sold his furniture; but we were very welcome to it as tenant for a
  year!</p>

  <p>&quot;Are there no furnished houses in this neighbourhood, at
  all?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No&#8212;e&#39;es&#8212;may be you&#39;ll get in at the
  shippus,&quot;&#8212;which, being Anglicized, is sheep-house; and
  away we toddled a mile and a half to the shippus&#8212;a nice old
  farm-house, with some pretensions to squiredom, and the inhabitants
  kind and civil as heart could wish.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, they sometimes let their rooms&#8212;to families larger
  than ours&#8212;they supplied them with every thing&#8212;waited on
  them&#8212;<i>did</i> for them&#8212;and, as for the children, there
  wasn&#39;t such a place in the county for nice fields to play
  in.&quot;</p>

  <p>We looked round the room&#8212;a good <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> high
  ceiling, large window. &quot;This is just the thing&#8212;and I am
  delighted we were told of your house.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It would have been very delightful, but&#8212;but we are
  full already, and we expect some of our own family home.&quot;</p>

  <p>And why didn&#39;t you tell us all this before?&#8212;we
  <i>nearly</i> said&#8212;and to this hour, we can&#39;t understand
  why there was such a profuse explanation of comforts&#8212;which
  <i>we</i> were never destined to partake of.</p>

  <p>&quot;But just across the road there is a very nice cottage, where
  you can get lodged&#8212;and we can supply you with milk, and any
  thing else you want.&quot;</p>

  <p>Oho! there is some hope for us yet; and a few minutes saw us in
  colloquy with the old gentleman, the proprietor of the house. With
  the usual politeness of the Welsh, he dilated on the pleasure of
  having agreeable visitors; and, with the usual Welsh habit of
  forgetting that people don&#39;t generally travel with beds and
  blankets, carpets and chairs, and tables and crockery, on their
  shoulders, he seemed rather astonished when the fact of the rooms
  destined for us being unfurnished was a considerable drawback. So, in
  not quite such high spirits as we started, we returned to the Hay.
  After a little rest, we again sported our seven-league boots, and
  took a solitary ramble across the Wye. A beautiful rising ground lay
  in front; and as our main object was to get up as high as we could,
  we went on and on, enjoying the increasing loveliness of the view,
  and wondering if a country so very charming was really left entirely
  destitute of furnished houses, and only enjoyed by the selfish
  natives, who had no room for pilgrims from a distance. In a nest of
  trees, surrounded on all sides by trimly kept orchards, and
  clustering round a venerable church, we came, at a winding of the
  road, on one of the most enchanting villages we ever saw. Near the
  gate of a modest-looking mansion, we beheld a gentleman in earnest
  conversation with a beggar. The beggar was a man of rags and
  eloquence; the gentleman was evidently a political economist, and
  rejected the poor man&#39;s petition &quot;upon principle.&quot; A
  lady, who was at the gentleman&#39;s side, looked at a poor little
  child the man carried in his arms. &quot;Go to your own place,&quot;
  said the gentleman; &quot;I never encourage vagrants.&quot; But it
  was too good-natured a voice to belong to a political economist.</p>

  <p>I wish I were as sure of a house as that the poor fellow will get
  a shilling, in spite of the new poor-law and Lord Brougham.</p>

  <p>The lady, after looking at the child, said something or other to
  her companion; and, as we turned away at the corner, we heard the
  discourager of vagrants apologizing to himself, and also reading a
  severe lecture on the impropriety of alms-giving. &quot;Remember, I
  disapprove of it entirely. You are indebted for it to this lady, who
  interposed for you.&quot; So the poor man got his shilling after all;
  and we considered it a favourable omen of success in getting a
  house.</p>

  <p>The next turn brought us to a dwelling which we think it a sort of
  sacrilege to call a public-house. The Baskerville Arms, in the
  village of Clyroe, is more fit for the home of a painter or a poet
  than for the retail of beer, &quot;to be drunk on the premises.&quot;
  There was a row of three nice clean windows in the front; the house
  seemed to stand in the midst of an orchard of endless extent, though
  in reality it faced the road; and, with a clear recollection of the
  line,</p><span class="i2">&quot;Oh, that for me some cot like this
  would smile,&quot;</span><br />

  <p>upon our heart and lips, we tapped at the door, and went into the
  room on the right hand. Every thing was in the neatest possible
  order&#8212;bunches of May in the grate, and bouquets of fresh
  flowers in two elegant vases upon the table. What nonsense to call
  this a public-house! It puts us much more in mind of Sloperton,
  Moore&#39;s cottage in Wiltshire; and in a finer neighbourhood than
  any part of Wiltshire can show.</p>

  <p>The landlady came; a fit spirit to rule over such a
  domain&#8212;the beau-ideal of tidiness and good humour. There were
  only two bedrooms; and one parlour was all they could give up.</p>

  <p>The raven of Barnaby Rudge had a hard fight of it to maintain his
  ground. We very nearly said die! for we had felt a sort of assurance
  that this was our haven at last.</p>

  <p>The landlady saw our woe.</p>

  <p>&quot;There&#39;s such a beautiful cottage,&quot; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> she said,
  &quot;a mile and a half further on.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is it furnished?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know. I think somehow it is. Would you
  like to go and see it? I don&#39;t know but my husband would put
  enough of furniture into it to do for you, if you liked it.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was, at all events, worth the trial. A little girl was sent
  with us to act as guide; and along a road we sauntered in supreme
  delight&#8212;so quiet, so retired, and so rich in leaf and blossom,
  that it seemed like a private drive through some highly-cultivated
  estate; and, finally, we reached the cottage. It stood on the side of
  an ascent; it commanded a noble view of the Herefordshire hills and
  the valley of the Wye; and there could be no doubt that it was the
  identical spot that the doctors had seen in their dreams, when they
  described the sort of dwelling we were to choose. I wish I were a
  half-pay captain, with a wife and three children, a taste for
  gardening, and a poney-carriage. I wish I were a Benedict in the
  honeymoon. I wish I were a retired merchant, with a good sum at the
  bank, and a predilection for farming pursuits. I wish I were a
  landscape painter, with a moderate fortune, realized by English art.
  I wish&#8212;but there is no use of wishing for any thing about the
  cottage, except that Mr Chaloner may furnish it at once, and let us
  be its tenant for two or three months.</p>

  <p>Mrs Chaloner, on our return to the Baskerville Arms, was gratified
  at our estimate of the surpassing beauties of the house. She would
  send her husband to us at the Hay the moment he returned; and, in the
  midst of &quot;gay dreams, by pleasing fancy bred,&quot; we returned
  to our barrack, and created universal jubilee by the prospect we
  unfolded.</p>

  <p>In a sort of delirium of good nature, we waited patiently till the
  soldiers had had all the attentions of the household again. We had
  almost a sense of enjoyment in all the discomforts we experienced.
  The doors that would not shut&#8212;the waiters that would not
  come&#8212;all things shone of the brightest rose-colour, seen
  through the anticipation of ten or twelve weeks&#39; residence in the
  paradise we had seen.</p>

  <p>Late at night Mr Chaloner was announced. He had heard the whole
  story from his worthy half; was in hopes he should be able to meet
  our wishes, but must consult his chief. If <i>he</i> agreed, he would
  see us before ten next morning&#8212;if not, we were to consider that
  the furniture could not be put in.</p>

  <p>And again we were slightly in the dumps.</p>

  <p>At half-past nine next morning we rang the bell, and ordered a
  carriage to be at the door at ten. If we hear from Chaloner, we shall
  drive at once to the Baskerville Arms; if not, there is no use of
  house-hunting in such an inhospitable region any more; let us get
  back to our friend at Abergavenny. If there is no house near
  <i>it</i>, let us go back to Chepstow; if we are disappointed there,
  let us go home, and tell the doctor we have changed the air
  enough.</p>

  <p>Ten o&#39;clock.&#8212;No Chaloner; but, as usual, also no
  carriage. Half-past ten.&#8212;No Chaloner. At eleven&#8212;the
  carriage;&#8212;and behold, in three hours more, the smiling face of
  Mr Morgan&#8212;the great long room and clean apartments of the
  Angel, and the end of our expectations of house and home, except in
  an hotel.</p>

  <p>We have no time on the present occasion to tell how fortune smiled
  upon us at last. How our landlord exerted himself, not only to make
  us happy while under his charge, but to get us into comfortable
  quarters in a large commodious house in the neighbourhood. In some
  future Number we will relate how jollily we fare in our new abode.
  How we are waited on like kings by the kindest host and hostess that
  ever held a farm; and how we travel in all directions, leaving the
  little ones at home, in a great strong gig, drawn by a horse that
  hobbles and joggles at a famous pace, and gives us plenty of good
  exercise and hearty laughter. All these things we will describe for
  the edification of people under similar circumstances to ourselves.
  The present lucubration being intended as a warning not to move from
  <i>one</i> home till another is secured; the next will be an example
  how country quarters are enjoyed, and a description of how pale
  cheeks are turned into red ones by living in the open air.</p>

  <h2><a name="TORQUATO_TASSO" id="TORQUATO_TASSO"></a>TORQUATO
  TASSO.</h2>

  <p>Any thing approaching to an elaborate criticism of the <i>Torquato
  Tasso</i> of Goethe we do not, in this place, intend to attempt; our
  object is merely to translate some of the more striking and
  characteristic passages, and accompany these extracts with such
  explanatory remarks as may be necessary to render them quite
  intelligible.</p>

  <p>There is, we cannot help remarking, a peculiar awkwardness in
  introducing a veritable poet amongst the personages of a drama. We
  cannot dissociate his name from the remembrance of the works he has
  written, and the heroes whom he has celebrated. Tasso&#8212;is it not
  another name for the <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>? and can he be
  summoned up in our memory without bringing with him the shades of
  Godfrey and Tancred? We expect to hear him singing of these champions
  of the cross; this was his life, and we have a difficulty in
  according to him any other. It is only after some effort that we
  separate the man from the poet&#8212;that we can view him standing
  alone, on the dry earth, unaccompanied by the creations of his fancy,
  his imaginative existence suspended, acting and suffering in the same
  personal manner as the rest of us. The poet brought into the ranks of
  the <i>dramatis personÃ¦!</i>&#8212;the creator of fictions converted
  himself into a fictitious personage!&#8212;there seems some strange
  confusion here. It is as if the magic wand were waved over the
  magician himself&#8212;a thing not unheard of in the annals of the
  black art. But then the second magician should be manifestly more
  powerful than the first. The second poet should be capable of
  overlooking and controlling the spirit of the first; capable, at all
  events, of animating him with an eloquence and a poetry not inferior
  to his own.</p>

  <p>For there is certainly this disadvantage in bringing before us a
  well-known and celebrated poet&#8212;we expect that he should speak
  in poetry of the first order&#8212;in such as he might have written
  himself. It is long before we can admit him to be neither more nor
  less poetical than the other speakers; it is long before we can
  believe him to talk for any other purpose than to say beautiful and
  tender things. Knowing, as we do, the trick of poets, and what is
  indeed their office as spokesmen of humanity, we suspect even when he
  is relating his own sufferings, and complaining of his own wrongs,
  that he is still only making a poem; that he is still busied first of
  all with the sweet expression of a feeling which he is bent on
  infusing, like an electric fluid, through the hearts of others.
  Altogether, he is manifestly a very inconvenient personage for the
  dramatist to have to deal with.</p>

  <p>These impressions wear off, however, as the poem
  proceeds&#8212;just as, in real life, familiar intercourse with the
  greatest of bards teaches us to forget the author in the companion,
  and the man of genius in the agreeable or disagreeable neighbour. In
  the drama of Goethe, we become quite reconciled to the new position
  in which the poet of the Holy Sepulchre is placed. <i>Torquato
  Tasso</i> is what in this country would be called a dramatic poem, in
  opposition to the tragedy composed for the stage, or <i>quasi</i> for
  the stage. The <i>dramatis personÃ¦</i> are few, the conduct of the
  piece is on the classic model&#8212;the model, we mean, of Racine;
  the plot is scanty, and keeps very close to history; there is little
  action, and much reflection.</p>

  <p>The <i>dramatis personÃ¦</i> are&#8212;</p>

  <p>Alphonso, Duke of Ferrara.<br />
  Leonora d&#39;Este, sister of the Duke.<br />
  Leonora Sanvitale, Countess of Scandiano.<br />
  Torquato Tasso.<br />
  Antonio Montecatino, Secretary of State.</p>

  <p>In Tasso we have portrayed to us the poetic temperament, with some
  overcharge in the tendency to distrust and suspicion, which belongs,
  as we learn from his biography, to the character of Tasso, and which
  again was but the symptom and precursor of that insanity to which he
  fell a prey. Both to relieve and develope this poetic character, we
  have its opposite (the representative of the practical understanding)
  in Antonio Montecatino, the secretary of state, the accomplished man
  of the world, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id=
  "Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> successful diplomatist. It may be well
  to mention that the speeches in the play given to Leonora d&#39;Este,
  with whom Tasso is in love, are headed <i>The Princess</i>; and it is
  her friend Leonora Sanvitale, Countess of Scandiano, who speaks under
  the name of <i>Leonora</i>.</p>

  <p>The conversation winds gracefully towards poetry and Tasso. We
  will answer at once the interesting question, whether the poet has
  represented Leonora d&#39;Este, the princess, as being in love with
  Tasso. He has; and very delicately has he made her express this
  sentiment. From the moment when, doubtless thinking of the living
  poet, she twined the laurel wreath which she afterwards deposited on
  the brow of Virgil, to the last scene where she leads the unhappy
  Tasso to a fatal declaration of his <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> passion, there is a gentle
  <i>crescendo</i> of what always remains, however, a very subdued and
  meditative affection. She loves&#8212;but like a princess; she muses
  over the danger to herself from suffering such a sentiment towards
  one in so different a rank of life to grow upon her; she never thinks
  of the danger to <i>him</i>, to the hapless Tasso, by her betrayal of
  an affection which she is yet resolved to keep within subjection. To
  be sure it may be said, that all women have something of the princess
  in them at this epoch of their lives. There is a wonderful
  selfishness in the heart, while it still asks itself whether it shall
  love or not. The sentiment of the princess is very elegantly
  disguised in the jesting vein in which she rallies Leonora
  Sanvitale&#8212;</p><span style=

    Venture to prattle of&quot;&#8212;
  </div><br />

  <p>Alphonso enters, and enquires after Tasso. Leonora answers, that
  she had seen him at a distance, with his book and tablets, writing
  and walking, and adds that, from some hint he had let fall, she
  gathered that his great work was near its completion; and, in fact,
  the princess soon after descries him coming towards
  them:&#8212;</p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">&quot;Slowly he
  comes,</span><br />

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">
    Stands still awhile as unresolved, then hastes,<br />
    With quicken&#39;d step, towards us; then again<br />
    Slackens his pace, and pauses.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Tasso enters, and presents his <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i> to his
  patron, the Duke of Ferrara. Alphonso, seeing the laurel wreath on
  the bust of Virgil, makes a sign to his sister; and the princess,
  after some remonstrance on the part of Tasso, transfers it from the
  statue to the head of the living poet. As she crowns him, she
  says&#8212;</p>

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">
    &quot;Thou givest me, Tasso, here the rare delight,<br />
    With silent act, to tell thee what I think.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>But the poet is no sooner crowned than he entreats that the wreath
  should be removed. It weighs on him, it is a burden, a pressure, it
  sinks and abashes him. Besides, he feels, as the man of genius must
  always feel, that not to wear the crown but to earn it, is the real
  joy as well as task of his life. The laurel is indeed for the bust,
  not for the living head.</p><span style=
  "margin-left: 18em;">&quot;Take it away!</span><br />

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">
    Oh take, ye gods, this glory from my brow!<br />
    Hide it again in clouds! Bear it aloft<br />
    To heights all unattainable, that still<br />
    My whole of life for this great recompense,<br />
    Be one eternal course.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>He obeys, however, the will of the princess, who bids him retain
  it. We are now introduced to the antagonist, in every sense of the
  word, of Tasso,&#8212;Antonio, secretary of state. In addition to the
  causes of repugnance springing from their opposite characters,
  Antonio is jealous of the favour which the young poet has won at the
  court of Ferrara, both with his patron and the ladies. This
  representative of the practical understanding speaks with admiration
  of the court of Rome, and the ability of the ruling pontiff. He
  says&#8212;</p>

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">
    &quot;No nobler object is there in the world<br />
    Than this&#8212;a prince who ably rules his people,<br />

    Because what fits him is alone commanded.
  </div>

  <p>Alphonso speaks of the poem which Tasso has just completed, and
  points to the crown which he wears. Then follow some of the unkindest
  words which a secretary of state could possibly bestow on the
  occasion.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg

    To prove to-day what all who serve the prince<br />

  </div>

  <p>Antonio then launches into an eloquent eulogium upon the
  <i>other</i> crowned one&#8212;upon Ariosto&#8212;which has for its
  object as well to dash the pride of the living, as to do homage to
  the dead. He adds, with a most cruel ambiguity,</p><span style=
  "margin-left: 12em;">&quot;Who ventures near this man to place
  himself,</span><br />

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">
    Even for his boldness may deserve a crown.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>The seeds of enmity, it is manifest, are plentifully sown between
  Antonio and Tasso. Here ends the 1st Act.</p>

  <p>At the commencement of the 2d Act, the princess is endeavouring to
  heal the wound that has been inflicted on the just pride of the poet,
  and she alludes, in particular, to the eulogy which Antonio had so
  invidiously passed upon Ariosto. The answer of Tasso deserves
  attention. It is peculiar to the poetic genius to estimate very
  differently at different times the value of its own labours.
  Sometimes do but grant to the poet his claim to the possession of
  genius, and his head strikes the stars. At other times, when
  contemplating the lives of those men whose actions he has been
  content to celebrate in song, he doubts whether he should not rank
  himself as the very prince of idlers. He is sometimes tempted to
  think that to have given one good stroke with the sword, were worth
  all the delicate touches of his pen. This feeling Tasso has finely
  expressed.</p><span style=
  "margin-left: 12em;">&quot;<i>Princess.</i>&#8212;When Antonio knows
  what thou hast done</span><br />

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">

  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg

  <p>When she continues to urge Tasso to make the friendship of
  Antonio, and assures him that the return of the minister has only
  procured him a friend the more, he answers:&#8212;</p><span style=
  "margin-left: 12em;">&quot;<i>Tasso.</i>&#8212;I hoped it once, I
  doubt it now.</span><br />

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">
    Instructive were to me his intercourse,<br />
    Useful his counsel in a thousand ways:<br />
    This man possesses all in which I fail.<br />
    And yet&#8212;though at his birth flock&#39;d every god,<br />
    To hang his cradle with some special gift&#8212;<br />
    The graces came not there, they stood aloof:<br />
    And he whom these sweet sisters visit not,<br />
    May possess much, may in bestowing be<br />
    Most bountiful, but never will a friend,<br />
    Or loved disciple, on his bosom rest.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>The tendency of this scene is to lull Tasso into the belief that
  he is beloved of the princess. Of course he is ardent to obey the
  latest injunctions he has received from her, and when Antonio next
  makes his appearance, he offers him immediately &quot;his hand and
  heart.&quot; The secretary of state receives such a sudden offer (as
  it might be expected a secretary of state would do) with great
  coolness; he will wait till he knows whether he can return the like
  offer of friendship. He discourses on the excellence of moderation,
  and in a somewhat magisterial tone, little justified by the relative
  intellectual position of the speakers. Here, again, we have a true
  insight into the character of the man of genius. He is
  modest&#8212;very&#8212;till you become too overbearing; he
  exaggerates the superiority in practical wisdom of men who have
  mingled extensively with the world, and so invites a tone of
  dictation; and yet withal he has a sly consciousness, that this same
  superiority of the man of the world consists much more in a certain
  fortunate limitation of thought than in any peculiar extension. The
  wisdom of such a man has passed through the mind of the poet, with
  this difference, that in his mind there is much beside this wisdom,
  much that is higher than this wisdom; and so it does not maintain a
  very prominent position, but gets obscured and
  neglected.</p><span style=

  </div><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 12em;">&quot;<i>Antonio.</i>&#8212;Trust
  rather to indulgence.&quot;</span><br />

  <p>We are in the high way, it is plain, to a duel. Tasso insists upon
  an appeal to the sword. The secretary of state contents himself with
  objecting the privilege or sanctity of the place, they being within
  the precincts of the royal residence. At the height of this debate,
  Alphonso enters. Here, again, the minister has a most palpable
  advantage over the poet. He insists upon the one point of view in
  which he has the clear right, and will not diverge from it; Tasso has
  challenged him, has done his utmost to provoke a duel within the
  walls of the palace; and is, therefore, amenable to the law. The Duke
  can do no other than decide against the poet, whom he dismisses to
  his apartment with the injunction that he is there to consider
  himself, for the present, a prisoner.</p>

  <p>In the three subsequent acts, there is still less of action; and
  we may as well relate at once what there remains of plot to be told,
  and then proceed with our extracts. Through the mediation of the
  princess and her friend, this quarrel is in part adjusted, and Tasso
  is released from imprisonment. But his spirit is wounded, and he
  determines to quit the court of Ferrara. He obtains permission to
  travel to Rome. At this juncture he meets with the princess. His
  impression has been that she also is alienated from him; her
  conversation removes and quite reverses this impression; in a moment
  of ungovernable tenderness he is about to embrace her; she repulses
  him and retires. The duke, who makes his appearance just at this
  moment, and who has been a witness to the conclusion of this
  interview, orders Tasso into confinement, expressing at the same time
  his conviction <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id=
  "Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> that the poet has lost his senses. He is
  given into the charge of Antonio, and thus ends the drama.</p>

  <p>Glancing back over the three last acts, whose action we have
  summed up so briefly, we might select many beautiful passages for
  translation; we content ourselves with the following.</p>

  <p>The princess and Leonora Sanvitale are conversing. There has been
  question of the departure of Tasso.</p><span style=

    Alas! that it should ever seem removed<br />
    Just one step off! Throughout the whole of life<br />
    Step after step, it leads our sick desire<br />
    E&#39;en to the grave. So rarely do men find<br />
    What yet seem&#39;d destined them&#8212;so rarely hold<br />
    What once the hand had fortunately clasp&#39;d;<br />
    What has been giv&#39;n us, rends itself away,<br />

    There is a happiness&#8212;we know it not,<br />
    We know it&#8212;and we know not how to prize.&quot;
  </div><br />

  <p>Tasso says, when he thought himself happy in the love of Leonora

    We find the pearl.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>It is in another strain that the poet speaks when Leonora
  Sanvitale attempts to persuade him that Antonio entertains in reality
  no hostility towards him. In what follows, we see the anger and
  hatred of a meditative man. It is a hatred which supports and
  exhausts itself in reasoning; which we might predict would never go
  forth into any act of enmity. It is <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> a mere sentiment, or rather
  the mere conception of a sentiment. For the poet rather thinks of
  hatred than positively hates.</p><span style=

  <div class="quoteindent10_5">

    The abandonment of all distinctive <i>self</i>.<br />
    Are all mankind to us so reasonable?<br />
    No, no! Man in his narrow being needs<br />
    Both feelings, love, and hate. Needs he not night<br />

    No! I will hold this man for evermore<br />

  <p>We conclude with a passage in which Tasso speaks of the
  irresistible passion he feels for his own art. He has sought
  permission of the Duke to retire to Rome, on the plea that he will
  there, by the assistance of learned men, better complete his great
  work, which he regards as still imperfect. Alphonso grants his
  request, but advises him rather to suspend his labour for the
  present, and partake, for a season, of the distractions of the world.
  He would be wise, he tells him, to seek the restoration of his
  health.</p><span style=

  A TALE OF WALES.</h2>

  <h3>BY JOSEPH DOWNES.</h3>

  <p>The inhabitants of the white mountain village of K&#8212;&#8212;,
  in Cardiganshire, were all retired to rest, it being ten o&#39;clock.
  No&#8212;a single light twinkled from under eaves of thick and mossy
  thatch, in one cottage apart, and neater than the rest, that skirted
  the steep <i>street</i>, (as the salmon fishers, its chief
  inhabitants, were pleased to call it,) being, indeed, the rock,
  thinly covered with the soil, and fringed with long grass, but rudely
  smoothed, where very rugged, by art, for the transit of a
  <i>gamboo</i> (cart with small wheels of entire wood) or sledge. The
  moonlight slept in unbroken lustre on the houses of one story, or
  without any but what the roof slope formed, and several appearances
  marked it as a fisher village. A black, oval, pitched basket, as it
  appeared, hung against the wall of several of the cottages, being the
  <i>coracle</i>, or boat for one person, much used on the larger Welsh
  rivers, very primitive in form and construction, being precisely
  described by CÃ¦sar in his account of the ancient Britons. Dried
  salmon and other fish also adorned others, pleasingly hinting of the
  general honesty and mutual confidence of the humble natives, poor as
  they were, for strangers were never thought of; the road, such as it
  was, merely mounting up to &quot;the hill&quot; (the lofty desert of
  sheepwalk) on one hand, and descending steeply to the river Tivy on
  the other. A deadened thunder, rising from some fall and brawling
  shallow &quot;rapid&quot; of the river, was the only sound, except
  the hooting of an owl from some old ivied building, a ruin
  apparently, visible on the olive-hued precipice behind. The russet
  mass of mountain, bulging, as it were, over the little range of cots,
  gave an air of security to their picturesque white beauty; while
  silver clouds curled and rolled in masses, grandly veiling their
  higher peaks, and sometimes canopied the roofs, many reddened with
  wall-flower; the walls also exhibiting streaks of green, where rains
  had drenched the vegetating thatch and washed down its tint of yellow
  green. Aged trees, green even to the trunks, luxuriant ivy enveloping
  them as well as the branches, stretched their huge arms down the
  declivity leading to the Tivy, the flashing of whose waters, through
  its rich fringe of underwood, caught the eye of any one standing on
  the ridge above. A solitary figure, tall and muffled, did stand with
  his back in contact with one of these oaks, so as to be hardly
  distinguishable from the trunk.</p>

  <p>A poet might imagine, looking at a Welsh village by moonlight,
  thus embosomed in pastoral mountains, canopied with those silver
  mists whose very motion was peace, and lulled by those soft solemn
  sounds, more peace-breathing than even silence, that <i>there</i>, at
  least, care never came; there peace, &quot;if to be found in the
  world,&quot; would be surely found; and soon that one light
  moving&#8212;that prettier painted door stealthily
  opening&#8212;would prove that peace confined to the elements only.
  &quot;Here I am!&quot; would be groaned to his mind&#39;s ear by the
  ubiquitous, foul fiend, Care; for thence emerged a female
  form&#8212;<i>simplex munditiis</i>&#8212;the exact description of it
  as to attire&#8212;rather tall than otherwise, but its chief
  characteristic, a drooping kind of bowed gait, in affecting unison
  with a melancholy settled over the pale features, so strongly as to
  be visible even by the moon at a very short distance. Brushing away a
  tear from each eye, as she held to her breast a little packet of some
  kind, as soon as she found (as she imagined) the coast clear, she
  proceeded, after fastening her door, toward one of the bowered
  footpaths <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg
  97]</a></span> leading to the river. The concealed man looked after
  her, prepared to follow, when some belated salmon fisher, his dark
  coracle, strapped to his back, nodding over his head, appeared. This
  lurking personage was nicknamed &quot;Lewis the Spy&quot; by the
  country people. He was the agent, newly appointed, to inspect the
  condition of a once fine but most neglected estate, which had
  recently come into possession of a &quot;Nabob,&quot; as they called
  him&#8212;a gentleman who had left Wales a boy, and was now on his
  voyage home to take possession of a dilapidated mansion called
  Talylynn. Lewis, his forerunner and plenipotentiary, was the dread
  and hate of the alarmed tenants. He had already ejected from his
  stewardship a good but rather indolent old man, John Bevan, who had
  grown old in the service of the former &quot;squire;&quot; and
  besides kept watch over the doings on the farms in an occult and
  treacherous manner, prowling round their &quot;folds&quot; by dusk,
  and often listening to conversations by concealing himself. Such was
  the man who now accosted the humble fisherman. Reverentially, as if
  to the terrible landlord himself, the peasant bared his head to his
  sullen representative.</p>

  <p>&quot;Who is that young woman?&quot; he enquired, sternly, though
  well knowing who she was.</p>

  <p>&quot;Dim Saesneg,&quot; answered the man, bowing.</p>

  <p>&quot;None of your Dim Saesneg to me, fellow,&quot; rejoined
  Lewis, sternly. &quot;Did not I hear you swearing in good English at
  a <i>Saesyn</i> (Englishman or Saxon) yesterday?&quot;</p>

  <p>The Welshman begged pardon in good Saxon, and answered at
  last&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, then, if it please your honour, her name be
  Winifred&#8212;her other name be Bevan&#8212;<i>Miss</i> Bevan, the
  school&#8212;her father be Mister Bevan of Llaneol, steward that was
  to our old squire of the great house, &#39;the
  Hall&#39;&#8212;Talylynn Hall&#8212;where there&#39;s a fine lake. I
  warrant your honour has fished there. You Saesonig gentlemen do
  mostly do nothing but fish and shoot in our poor country; I beg
  pardon, but you look <i>Saesoniadd</i>, (Saxonlike,) I was
  thinking&#8212;fine lake, but the trout be not to
  compare&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; interrupted the other laughing, &quot;your
  English tongue can wag as glib as your outlandish one. A sweetheart
  in the case there, isn&#39;t there? What the devil&#39;s she going
  down to the river for at this time of night, else?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, to be sure there be!&quot; the man answered.
  &quot;<i>We</i> all know that; poor thing, she had need find some
  comforter in all her troubles&#8212;her father so poor, and in debt
  to this strange foreigner, who&#39;s on the water coming home now,
  and has made proposals for her in marriage, so they do <i>say</i>;
  but it&#39;s like your honour knows more of that than I do&#8212;for
  be not you Mr Lewis, I beg pardon, Lewis Lewis, esquire?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And what do you know of this sweetheart of hers? Is he her
  <i>first</i>, think ye? <i>I</i> doubt that,&quot; rejoined Lewis,
  not noticing his enquiry&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>You</i> may doubt what your honour pleases, but <i>we</i>
  don&#39;t&#8212;no; never man touched her <i>hand</i> hardly, never
  one her lips, before&#8212;I did have it from her mother; but as for
  this one she&#39;s found at last, we wish she&#39;d a
  better&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s the matter with him, then?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, nothing more than that he&#39;s poor, sir&#8212;poor;
  and that <i>we</i> don&#39;t know much about the
  stranger&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;What &#39;<i>we</i>&#39; do you mean, while you talk of
  &#39;we&#39;?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Lord bless ye, sir, why us all of this bankside, and this
  side Tivy, the great family of us, she&#39;s just like <i>our</i>
  little girl to us all; for don&#39;t she have all our young ones to
  give &#39;em learning, whether the Cardigan ladies pay for &#39;em or
  don&#39;t? And wasn&#39;t poor dear old John Bevan the man who would
  lend every farmer in the parish a help in money or any way, only for
  asking? So it is, you see, she has grown up among us. This young man,
  though he may be old for what I know, never seeing him in my
  life&#8212;you see, sir, we on this side of Tivy are like strangers
  to the Cardy men, t&#39;other side&#8212;<i>they</i> are
  <i>Cardie&#39;s</i>, sure enow, <i>true</i> ones, as the Saxon
  foreign folk do call us <i>all</i> of this shire. I wouldn&#39;t
  trust one of &#39;em t&#39;other side, no further than I could throw
  him. I&#39;ll tell ye a story&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg
  98]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;Never mind. What about David?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, ho! You know his name, then? Well, and that&#39;s all
  <i>I</i> do&#8212;pretty nigh. He lives with a woman who fostered him
  after his own mother died in travail with him, they do say, who has a
  little house, beyond that lump of a mountain, above all the others,
  we see by daylight; he has been in England, and is a strange one for
  music. He owes (owns, possesses,) a beautiful
  harp&#8212;<i>beautiful</i>! The Lord knows, some do say, that&#39;s
  all he owes in the world, so (except) his coracle and the salmon he
  takes, and what young people do give him at weddings and biddings,
  where he goes to play: and what&#39;s that to keep a wife? Poor Davy
  <i>Telynwr</i>! Yet, by my soul, we all say we&#39;d rather see her
  his than this foreigner gentleman&#39;s, who has almost broke her
  heart, they say, by coming between her and her own dear
  one.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He&#39;s <i>not</i> come yet,&quot; muttered the other,
  sullenly; adding, sharply and bitterly, &quot;Mighty good friends you
  all are, to wish her married to a beggar, a vagabond harper, rather
  than to a gentleman.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why&#8212;to be sure, sir&#8212;but vows be
  vows&#8212;love&#39;s love&#8212;and to tell truth, sir,&quot; (the
  Welsh blood of the Cardy peasant was now up,) &quot;if any foreign,
  half Welsh, half wild Indian, sort of gentleman had sent his fine
  letters, asking my sweetheart&#39;s friends to turn <i>me</i> off, in
  my courting days, and prepare my wench to be his lady, instead of my
  wife&#8212;I&#39;d have&#8212;I&#39;d have&quot;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>What</i> would you have done?&quot; asked the other,
  laughing heartily.</p>

  <p>&quot;Cursed him to St Elian!&quot; roared the other; then,
  dropping his voice into a solemn tone, &quot;put him into his
  well.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> <i>I&#39;d</i> have
  plagued him, I warrant. But for <i>my</i> part,&quot; added the man
  archly, &quot;I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any <i>squire</i> lover
  in the case&#8212;nor that your honour ever said there is.&quot; The
  agent here vanished, as if in haste, abruptly, down the steep
  path.</p>

  <p>During this conversation, Winifred had reached the river. While
  she stands expectant, not in happiness, but in tears, it is time to
  say a few words of the lover so expected.</p>

  <p>David, who was lately become known &quot;on t&#39;other side
  Tivy,&quot; by the name of <i>Nosdethiol Telynwr</i>, that is,
  &quot;night-walking harper,&quot; was an idle romantic young man,
  almost grown out of youth, who had long lived away from Wales, where
  he had neither relative nor friend but one aged woman who had been
  his first nurse, he having been early left an orphan. Without settled
  occupation or habits, he was understood almost to depend for bread on
  the salmon he caught, and trifling presents received. A small
  portable harp, of elegant workmanship, (adorned with
  &quot;<i>real</i> silver,&quot; so <i>ran the tale</i>,) was the
  companion of his moonlight wanderings. He had a whim of serenading
  those who had never heard of a &quot;serenade,&quot; but were not the
  less sensible of a placid pleasure at being awakened by soft music in
  some summer sight. The simple mountain cottagers, whose slumbers he
  thus broke or soothed, often attributed the sweet sounds to the
  kindness of some wandering member of the &quot;Fair Family,&quot; or
  <i>Tylwyth TÃªg</i>, the fairies. Nor did his figure, if discovered
  vanishing between the trees, if some one ventured to peep out, in a
  light night, dispel the illusion; for it appears, that the fairy of
  old Welsh superstition was not of diminutive stature.&quot;<a name=
  "FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"
  class="fnanchor">[22]</a> That he was &quot;very learned,&quot; had
  somewhere acquired much knowledge of books, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> however
  little of men, was reported on both sides of the river; and these few
  particulars were almost all that was known even to Winifred, who had
  so rashly given all her thoughts, all her hopes, all her heart
  almost, (reserving only one sacred corner for her beloved parents,)
  to this dangerous stranger&#8212;for stranger he was still to her in
  almost all outer circumstances of life. This was partly owing to the
  interposition of that narrow river, however trivial a line of
  demarcation that must appear to English people, accustomed to cross
  even great rivers of commerce, like the Thames, as they would step
  over a brook or ditch, by the frequent aid of bridges and boats. In
  Wales, bridges are too costly to be common. When reared, some unlucky
  high flood often sweeps them away. Intercourse by ferryboats and
  fords is liable to long interruptions. The dwellers of opposite sides
  frequent different markets, and belong frequently to different
  counties. The nature of the soil also often differs wholly. Hence it
  happens, that sometimes a farmer, whose eye rests continually on the
  little farm and fields of another, on the opposite &quot;bank,&quot;
  rising from the river running at the base of his own confronting
  hill-side, lives on, ignorant almost of the name, quite of the
  character, of their tenant, to whom he could almost make himself
  heard by a shout&#8212;if it happens that neither ford, ferry, nor
  bridge, is within short distance.</p>

  <p>&quot;The people of t&#39;other side,&quot; is an expression
  implying nearly as much strangeness, and contented ignorance of these
  neighbours, and no neighbours, as the same spoken by the people of
  Dover or Calais, of those t&#39;other side the Channel. It was not,
  therefore, surprising that poor Winifred (albeit not imprudent, save
  in this new-sprung passion,) might have said with the poet, too
  truly,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;I know not, I ask not, what guilt&#39;s in
      that heart;</span> <span class="i2">I but know that I love thee,
      whatever thou art.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This wild reckless sentiment (though scarcely true to love&#39;s
  nature, which is above all things curious about all belonging to its
  object) did in her case illustrate her feelings. Winifred had lately
  disclosed to her dear &quot;unknown&quot; the ruin impending over her
  father, the result of his mingled good-nature and indolence, he
  having permitted the tenants to run in arrears, and suffer
  dilapidations, as already said;&#8212;the long neglect, however, of
  the East Indian landlord being at the root of the evil, who had been
  as remiss in his dealings with the steward as the steward with the
  tenants. The first appearance of this newly appointed agent, who
  announced the early return of his employer to take possession of the
  decayed manor-house, was as sudden as ominous of the ruin of old John
  Bevan. The hope he held out of the &quot;Nabob&quot; espousing his
  long-remembered child, Winifred, and the consequent salvation of her
  father, seemed too romantic to be believed. Yet this man proved
  himself duly accredited by his principal, and exercised his power
  already with severity. The fine old house of Talylynn, a mansion
  rising close to a small beautiful lake skirted by an antique park
  with many deer, was already almost prepared for the reception of the
  &quot;squire from abroad.&quot; Meanwhile&#8212;what most excited the
  ill-will of the tenantry&#8212;this odious persecutor of the
  all-beloved John Bevan had also furbished up a neat old house
  adjoining the park gate, as a residence for himself; while poor
  Bevan&#39;s farm-house of Llaneol was suffered to fall into ruinous
  decay&#8212;the new steward even neglecting to keep it
  weather-tight.</p>

  <p>Thus decayed, and almost ruinous, it seemed more in harmony with
  the fortunes of the ever resigned and patient man. But his less
  placid dame, after losing the services of Winifred, had fallen into a
  peevish sort of despondency, as the father, missing her society, and
  its finer species of consolation, had sunk into a more placid
  apathy.</p>

  <p>David had received the hint of her possible self-devotion to the
  coming &quot;squire&quot; with very little philosophy, little temper,
  and no allowance for the feelings of an only daughter expecting to
  see a white-headed, fond father, dragged from his home to a jail. He
  had been incensed; he had wronged her by imputations of sordid
  motives&#8212;of pride, of contempt for <i>himself</i> as a
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
  100]</a></span> beggar; and at last broke from her in sullen
  resentment, after requiring her to bring all his letters, at their
  next interview, which was to be a farewell one. And now she was
  bringing every thing she had received from him, in sad obedience to
  this angry demand. Nor was all his wrath, his injustice, and his
  despair, really unacceptable to her secret heart. She would not have
  had him patient under even the prospective possibility of her
  marrying another.</p>

  <p>But his manner at this meeting announced a change in his whole
  sentiments.</p>

  <p>His very first words, (cold, yet kind, but how altered in tone!)
  with his constrained deportment, expressed his acquiescence in her
  purpose, whether pride, jealousy, or a juster estimate of her filial
  virtue, had induced the stern resolve.</p>

  <p>Winifred had never known the full strength of her own passion till
  now! The idea of an early eternal end to their ungratified loves,
  which had for some time become familiar to her own secret mind,
  assumed a new and strange terror for her imagination the moment it
  ceased to be hers <i>alone</i>. The shock was novel and overpowering,
  when the separation seemed acquiesced in by him, thus putting it out
  of her own power to hesitate further between devotion to the lover or
  to the parent. His reconciled manner, his calm taking her by the
  hand, even the kiss which she could not resist, were more painful
  than his utmost resentment would have been. Yet there was a sad
  severity in his look, as his fine countenance of deep melancholy
  turned to the bright moon, which a little comforted her, and
  indicated that it was pride rather than patience which led to his
  affected contentment. <i>He</i> had not a parent to nerve <i>his</i>
  heart to the sacrifice.</p>

  <p>&quot;I passed <i>your</i> home yesterday,&quot; he began
  sarcastically: &quot;it is a fine place again, already, that hall of
  Talylynn, and wants only as fine a mistress.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You wrong me, David <i>bach</i>! on my life and soul you do,
  <i>dear</i> David!&quot; she replied sobbing. &quot;&#39;Tis a
  hateful hall&#8212;a horrid hall! If it were only I, your poor lost
  Winifred, that was to suffer, oh! how much sooner would I be carried
  dead into a vault, than alive, and dressed in all the finest silks of
  India, into that dreadful house you twit me with!&#8212;unkind,
  unkind!&quot; And almost fainting, her head sunk upon his shoulder,
  and his arm was required to support her.</p>

  <p>Instantly she recovered, and stood erect. &quot;But oh, David,
  there is another dreadful place, and another dear being besides you,
  dearest, that I think of night and day! The horrid castle
  jail&#8212;my dear, dear father! Oh, if this Lewis speaks truth, and
  if that strange boy&#8212;I only knew him as a boy, you
  know&#8212;who has power to ruin him, (<i>will</i> surely ruin him!)
  will <i>indeed</i> forgive him all he owes; will really become his
  son&#8212;his son-in-law, instead of his merciless creditor; oh!
  could I refuse <i>my</i> part, shocking part though it be? I should
  not suffer long, David&#8212;I feel I should not.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And pray, what <i>kind</i> of youth&#8212;<i>boy</i> as you
  are pleased to call him&#8212;was this nabob then?&quot; enquired her
  lover, apparently startled at learning the fact of her having had
  some previous knowledge of his powerful rival.</p>

  <p>&quot;A youth! a mere child, when I last saw him,&quot; she
  answered. &quot;I thought you had known all about him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nothing more than his name; how came you in his
  company?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;His father, living in India, was half-brother to our old
  squire, Fitzarthur of Talylynn. His mother dying, his widower father,
  whose health was broken up before, came over here, this being his
  native country, in hope of recovering it; but died at Talylynn,
  leaving one child, that little orphan boy, heir, after his
  half-uncle&#39;s death, to all this property. You have often heard me
  tell how like two brothers my dear father and <i>our</i> old squire
  were always&#8212;though father was only a steward&#8212;how he used
  to have me at the great house, for a month at a time, where he had me
  taught by a lady who lived with him, before I went to school; and so
  I used often to see that little boy in black&#8212;very queer and
  sullen he was thought; but he had no playfellow, except an owl that
  he kept tame, I remember, and cried when he buried <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> him in
  the garden,&#8212;the only time he was ever known to cry, he was so
  still and stern. It was <i>I</i> caught him, then acting the sexton
  by himself, close by the high box hedge, under a great tree. I
  remember the spot now, and remember how angry I made him by
  laughing.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you did wrong to laugh, if it was so serious to
  him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh! but I did not know he was crying when I laughed, and
  <i>was</i> sorry when I detected it. One thing was, the old gentleman
  was so jovial, and loved a good laugher, and was rather too fond of
  wine, and mostly out hunting, so that the poor boy had to find his
  own amusement. He seemed fond of me, but hated, he said, his uncle,
  and his hounds, and his ways, and every thing there but his own owl;
  so that nobody was sorry when he was fetched back to India, to be put
  in the where he was to make the fortune he has now made, I
  suppose.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And your little heart did throb a little, and sink for a
  day, when this playfellow was shipped off for life, as you thought,
  and you <i>did</i> remember his funeral tears over his owl,
  and&quot;&#8212;a quaver of voice and betrayed earnestness revealed
  the jealous pang shooting across the heart of the speaker; but her
  own was too heavy and deeply anxious to prolong this desultory
  talk.</p>

  <p>She only added&#8212;&quot;Heaven knows how little I thought that
  poor stranger boy would ever grow to be what he is to me
  now.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>What he is to you?</i> Why, what then is he,
  Winifred?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The horror of my thoughts, my dreams,
  my&quot;&#8212;&#8212;she answered sobbing. &quot;But why should I
  say so? Wicked I am to feel him so, if he is <i>indeed</i> to be the
  saviour of my dear, dear father!&quot; And she turned away to shed
  relieving tears.</p>

  <p>&quot;And this little packet contains my letters&#8212;<i>all</i>,
  does it?&quot; he asked, touching the small parcel she had deposited
  within a cleft of the hollow river-side tree, by which they stood,
  the post-office of their happier days, where, concealed by thick moss
  gathered from the bole, those letters had every one been searched for
  and found&#8212;with what a leap of heart, first felt! how fondly
  thrust into her bosom, for the leisure delight of opening at
  home&#8212;and all in vain!</p>

  <p>&quot;All but one,&quot; she answered tremulously; &quot;I brought
  then because you bade me&#8212;but you were so angry
  <i>then</i>&#8212;let me take them back?&quot; and she clutched them
  eagerly. &quot;At least we may wait, David&#8212;we don&#39;t know
  yet; I do suspect that Lewis Lewis&#8212;he shuns me as if he was
  conscious of some wickedness; he&#39;s as horrid to me as his
  master&#8212;the thought of his master&#8212;I do forbode something
  awful from that man! It was but just before I heard you brushing
  among those great low branches, in your coracle, that I fancied I saw
  him stealing, as if to watch, or perhaps waylay you; but I am full of
  dismal thoughts.&quot;</p>

  <p>He had not the heart to force his letters, so reluctantly
  resigned, from her chilly hand. But he held in his what was
  calculated to inspire pain quite as poignant. In the fond admiration
  of her fancy&#39;s first object, she had vehemently longed for a
  portrait of that rather singular face&#8212;a long oval, with lofty
  forehead, already somewhat corrugated by habits of deep thought, in
  his lonely night-loving existence; its mixture of passion, dumb
  poetry, its constitutional or adventitious profound melancholy, ever
  present, till his countenance gradually lighted up, after her coming
  and her animating discourse, like some deep gloomy valley growing
  light as the sun surmounts a lofty bank, gleaming through its pines.
  She had forced him to take a piece of money for procuring this so
  desired keepsake, and every time they met, she had fondly hoped to
  have the little portrait put into her hand. Now, instead, he
  presented the unused money&#8212;would she retain the image of a
  sweetheart in the home of her stern and lordly husband? Her heart
  confessed that she must no longer wish for it&#8212;but it sunk
  within her at the thought, how soon that innocent would be a guilty
  wish; and when he surprised her with the money so suddenly, she
  involuntarily shuddered, forebore to close her hand upon it, let it
  slide from her palm, and murmured only with her innocent plaintiff
  voice, &quot;I shall never have your picture
  now&#8212;<i>never</i>!&quot; And <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> then she dejected her
  eyes to the little parcel of letters, written, received, kissed, and
  kept, like something holy, so long in vain; and all the charming
  hopeful hours in which each was found, when some longer absence had
  given to each a deeper interest, and higher value&#8212;those hours
  never to return, came shadowing over her mind, memory, and soul, and
  a lethargy of despairing grief imposed a ghost-like semblance of calm
  on her whole figure, and her face slowly assumed a deadly paleness,
  even to the lips, visible even by the moon. David grew alarmed,
  relapsed into the full fondness of former hours, folded the dumb,
  drooping, and agonized young woman in his arms, to his bosom! without
  her betraying consciousness, and yet she was not fainting; she stood
  upright, and her eyes, though fixed as if glazed, still expressed
  love in their almost shocking fixedness.</p>

  <p>The young man grew terrified. &quot;Look up! speak to me!
  Winifred, <i>dear</i> Winifred, my <i>own</i> Winifred, in spite of
  all!&quot; he broke forth. &quot;Smile at me, my dearest, once more,
  and keep these foolish letters you so value, keep them
  <i>all</i>.&quot; And he thrust them into her passive hand.</p>

  <p>Aroused by his words and action, poor Winifred, starting with a
  gasp, wildly kissed the little packet, and thanked him by an embrace
  more passionate than her prudence or modesty would have permitted,
  had they been happy.</p>

  <p>&quot;And my portrait&#8212;my ugliness in paint, and on ivory
  too, dearest, you shall have yet, as you desire it,&quot; he added,
  forcing pleasantry; &quot;only do not fall into that frightful sort
  of trance again.&quot;</p>

  <p>He little knew what deadliness of thoughts, almost of purpose, had
  produced that long abstracted fit. The most exemplary prudence (the
  result of a sound mind and heart) had characterised this young woman
  till now. While yet at home, her bodily activity surprised her
  parents. Their means having been long but low, they had little help
  in their dairy and small farming concerns. She often surprised her
  mother with the sight of the butter already churned, the ewes already
  milked, or the cheeses pressed, when she arose. She was abroad in the
  heavy dews of morning, when the sun at midsummer rises in what is
  properly the night, regarded as the hour of rest&#8212;abroad, happy
  and cheerful, calling the few cows in the misty meadows. Nor did this
  habit of early rising prevent her indulging at night her <i>one</i>
  unhappy habit&#8212;romance-reading; a pleasure which she enjoyed
  through the kindness of many ladies of the town of Cardigan, who
  afterwards established her in her school at K&#8212;&#8212;. They
  supplied her with these dangerous volumes that exalted
  passion&#8212;love in excess&#8212;above all the aims and pursuits of
  life: represented her who loves most madly as most worthy of
  sympathy; and even, too often, crowned the heroine with the palm of
  self-martyrdom&#8212;making suicide itself no longer a crime or
  folly, but almost a virtue, under certain contingencies.</p>

  <p>When poverty increased, the activity of her powerful intellect was
  brought into display, as much as her personal activity had been, in
  devising resources. She had acquired some skill in drawing, through
  the kindness of the neighbouring gentry, and she improved herself so
  far as to execute very respectable drawings of the ruins of Kilgerran
  Castle, on her own river, and other fine scenes of Wales; and these
  were sold for her (or rather for her parents) by others, at fairs and
  wakes, where she never appeared herself. When residing at the
  village, her wheel was heard in the morning before others were
  stirring, and at late night, after every other one was still. Her
  little light, gleaming in the lofty village, espied between the
  hanging trees, was the guiding star of the belated fisher up the
  narrow goat&#39;s-path which led to the village, who could always
  obtain light for his pipe at &quot;<i>Miss Bevan&#39;s</i>, the
  school,&quot; when not a casement had exhibited a taper for hours.
  But the evil of all this wear and tear of mind and body was, that it
  maintained an unnatural state of excitement in the one, and of
  weakness (disguised by that fever of imagination) in the other.
  Sleep, the preserver of health and tranquillity of mind, was
  exchanged for lonely emotions excited by night reading. She was
  weeping over the dramatist&#39;s fifth act of tragedy, or the
  romancist&#39;s <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id=
  "Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> more morbid appeals to the passions,
  while nature demanded rest. Then an accidental meeting with the young
  harper&#8212;he recovering a book she had dropped into the Tivy out
  of her hand, from having fallen asleep through exertion, and
  restoring it with a grace quite romance-hero like&#8212;produced a
  new era, and new excitement&#8212;that of the heart. Thenceforth, she
  became &quot;of imagination all compact,&quot; however her strong
  sense preserved her purity and virtue. But no more dangerous lover
  could be imagined than such a loose hanger-on, rather than member, of
  society as David the <i>Telynwr</i>&#8212;for <i>his</i> nature was
  <i>hers</i>; except, perhaps, in virtuous resolution, he was a female
  Winifred. Yet he possessed a romantic &quot;leaning, at least, to
  virtue&#39;s side.&quot;</p>

  <p>This was oddly exemplified now, (to return to their present
  position;) for as soon as her partial recovery had removed his alarm,
  he grew cold, and almost severe in his manner, and broke
  forth&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>So</i>, then, Winifred would willingly pore over the
  love-letters of a sweetheart while under a husband&#39;s roof! She
  thinks this beauty enough for <i>him</i>&#8212;she would reserve her
  thoughts, wishes, every thing else, for his old rival;&#8212;every
  thing but what a ring, and a few words, makes his right by law, the
  poor husband is to leave to any old sweetheart that may come prowling
  round his gates! That&#39;s gross! Is it <i>not</i>,
  Winifred?&quot;</p>

  <p>Alas! the heart-broken young woman had been meditating on far
  other issue to their brief attachment! On death!&#8212;death on her
  wedding-day, as the only means of preserving at once her father&#39;s
  liberty and her own virtue; for her reading had taught her that
  marriage, where the mind and heart were so wholly engaged elsewhere,
  was no better than legalised prostitution. With a look of dark
  intensity of meaning, Winifred broke her lengthened silence, saying
  hollowly&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;I was not looking so far forward&#8212;I was not looking
  beyond <i>that</i> day&#8212;not to
  that&quot;&#8212;&#8212;<i>night</i>, she would have said, but
  modesty stopped her speech. &quot;And <i>you</i> can be so calm! so
  thoughtful! <i>You</i> can be reasoning about my duties during a
  life! you can be pleading for <i>my</i> future husband! Oh, I wish I
  were like you! And yet, I bless God, that you are not like <i>me</i>!
  I would not have you feel as I do for the world! No, not even know
  what I am feeling, thinking, dearest, at this moment.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No!&quot; David again muttered, more and more severely,
  &quot;I cannot submit to have my letters and trifling keepsakes to be
  tossed about by <i>him</i>! It is weakness to wish it, Winifred
  Bevan; and worse for me to grant it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You shall have them all&#8212;all&#8212;all!&quot; she
  exclaimed in passionate agony composed of tenderness, anguish, anger,
  recklessness, with a bitterness of irony keener to her own heart,
  than to him who roused that terrible reaction of her nature.
  &quot;I&#39;ll run and fetch them all this very night! Oh,
  they&#39;ll serve for <i>your</i> new love. You may copy your
  letters. I&#39;m sure, if she have a human heart, they&#39;ll move
  it&#8212;they&#39;ll win it! Strike my name out, and you may send the
  very letters. She will not know that another heart was broken by
  giving them up! She will not know the stains are tears of pleasure
  dropped upon them! And you shall have <i>that</i> too, if you
  will&#8212;if you must!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Which? what? dearest creature, but compose
  yourself&#8212;pray do!&quot; he said, again alarmed.</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>That</i> you sent with the lock of hair&#8212;<i>this</i>
  hair!&quot; she answered wildly. &quot;But you <i>will</i> leave me
  the little lock? Oh, there&#39;s plenty to cut for <i>another</i>
  here!&quot; and she laughed hysterically, frightfully, and played
  with his profusion of raven hair; but it was mournful play.
  &quot;Leave me&#8212;<i>do</i> leave poor Winifred that, David, for
  the love of God! In mercy, leave it! I will not ask for the picture
  again&#8212;I will not <i>wish</i> it, if <i>you</i> say I must not;
  but the hair&#8212;the poor bit of hair&#8212;he! oh, misery! he
  shall never see it! I myself will never cry over it&#8212;never look
  at it, if you think it wrong&#8212;never till I&#39;m dying,
  David&#8212;dying! There will be no harm then, you know, in
  looking&#8212;in a poor dying creature&#39;s look, who has done with
  passions, life, love, every thing. And none&#8212;none shall see it
  but those who lay me out, or they who find my&#8212;oh! we none of us
  know where we may die, or how! It may be alone,
  dearest&#8212;<i>alone</i>! Oh, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> the comfort it will be
  to have a part of very <i>you</i> to hold&#8212;to hold by, like this
  very hand, in my death-damp one. Let me have it!&quot; she shrilly
  implored, in delirious energy. &quot;I want it to take with me to my
  death-bed&#8212;to my death-pit&#8212;my grave, whatever it may
  be&#8212;to heaven itself&#8212;to our place of meeting again, if it
  were possible! Oh, that it <i>were</i> possible! and that I might
  bring back to you there the kiss&#8212;the long kiss&#8212;you shall
  leave on these wretched lips when we part for ever and for ever here!
  <i>Will</i> you take it from me, David, my heart, my soul? No, you
  will not?&quot;</p>

  <p>The crisis of love&#39;s parting agony was at its height.
  Half-conscious of her own dangerous prostration of soul and mind
  under its power, she turned from the dear object, and rested her
  forehead against the trunk of their old tree of assignation; and a
  steady, sadder shower of tears, relieving her full heart, followed
  this storm of various and rapid emotions, sweeping over one weakened
  mind, like thunderclouds charged with electric fire, borne on a
  whirlwind over a whole landscape, in a few minutes of mingled gloom
  and glory. For, in the sublime of passion, whatever be its nature, is
  there not a terrible joy, a secret glorifying of the earthy nature,
  which we may compare to such elemental war&#8212;now hanging all
  heaven in mourning, and bringing night on noonday, and presently
  illuminating that day with a ghastly, momentary light, brilliant even
  beyond its own?</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

  <p>Llaneol, the dilapidated farm-house of the expelled steward, old
  Bevan, stood beautifully in a wooded glen, watered by a shallow
  stream, between a brook and river in size. A pretty greensward, of
  perpetual vivid hue, stretched quite up to the threshold&#8212;its
  &quot;fold,&quot; or farm-yard, being small, and situated behind. A
  wooded mountain rose opposite, topped by a range of many-tinted
  cliffs, splintered like thunder-stricken battlements, and resembling,
  in their fretted and timeworn fronts, rich cathedral architecture in
  ruins. Extensive sheep-walks rose in russet, lofty barrenness behind,
  but allowing below breadth for venerable oaks, and a profusion of
  underwood, to shelter the white, but no longer well-thatched,
  farm-cottage, and screening that umbrageous valley from the colder
  wind; while the many sheep, seen, and but just seen, dotting the
  lofty barrier, beautified the scene by the pastoral ideas which their
  dim-seen white inspired. Only the songs of birds distinguished the
  noonday from the night, unless when the flail was heard in the barn,
  through the open doors of which, coloured by mosses, the river
  glistened, and the green, with its geese, gleamed the more
  picturesquely for this rustic perspective.</p>

  <p>As Winifred was approaching this tranquil vale&#8212;her native
  vale&#8212;after an absence at the town of Cardigan, where she had
  been seeking assistance for her father, with little success, she was
  startled by the unusual sound of many voices, and soon saw, aghast,
  the whole of the rustic furniture standing about on the pretty green,
  her infant play-place; the noisy auctioneer mounted on the well-known
  old oaken table; even her mother&#39;s wheel was already knocked down
  and sold, and her father&#39;s own great wicker chair was ready to be
  put up, while rude boys were trying its rickety antiquity by a
  furious rocking.</p>

  <p>On no occasion is so much joviality indulged (in Wales) as on that
  of an auction &quot;under a distress for rent,&quot; (which was the
  case here)&#8212;an occasion of calamity and ruin to the owner. Even
  in the event of an auction caused by a death, where the common course
  of nature has removed the possessor from those &quot;goods and
  chattels&quot; which are now useless to him, a sale is surely a
  melancholy spectacle to creatures who use their minds, and possess
  feelings befitting a brotherhood of Christians, or even heathens. To
  see the inmost recesses of &quot;home, sweet home,&quot; thrown open
  to all strangers; the most treasured articles (often descended as
  heir-looms from ancestors, and therefore possessing an intrinsic
  value, quite unsuspected by others, for the owner,) ransacked, tossed
  from hand to hand, and at last &quot;knocked down&quot; at a nominal
  price&#8212;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id=
  "Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>even this is a mournful exhibition.
  But where the ruthless hand of his brother man has wrested those
  valuables from their possessor, instead of inevitable death&#39;s
  tearing him from them&#8212;where that very owner and his family are
  present, sadly listening to the ceaseless jokes (thoughtlessly
  inhuman) lavished by the auctioneer, and re-echoed by the crowd, over
  those old familiar objects&#8212;witnessing the happy excitement of
  rival bidders, and the universal pleasure over his ruin, like the cry
  and flocking of vultures over a battle-field, witnessed by wretches
  still alive, though mortally wounded; what can exceed the shocking
  transgression of human brotherhood presented by such a scene! A scene
  of every-day occurrence&#8212;a scene never seeming to excite even
  one reflection kindred to these natural, surely, and obvious
  feelings&#8212;yet one terribly recalling to the pensive observer
  that axiom, <i>Homo ad hominem lupus est!</i> Doubtless the
  fraudulent or utterly reckless debtor is, in the eye of reason, the
  first &quot;wolfish&quot; assailant of his brother. But how many of
  these familiar tragedies are as truly the result of unforeseen,
  unforeseeable contingencies, as diseases or other events, considered
  the visitations of God! One, or two, or three, sick and heavy hearts
  and wounded minds, in the midst of a hundred happy, light ones,
  buoyed up by fierce cupidity and keen bargain-hunting, and
  exhilarated by drink and by fun, and all drawn together by the misery
  of those outcast few.</p>

  <p>Poor Bevan had been taken by surprise in this sudden execution,
  put in by his treacherous supplanter, Lewis Lewis. But what most
  excited the anger of his old attached neighbours, was the fact that
  many of these goods were bought by an agent of Lewis, to finish
  furnishing his own newly repaired house by the old park wall.
  Winifred learned that her parents had removed to a friendly
  neighbour&#39;s, at some distance, but suspected the worst&#8212;his
  removal to jail.</p>

  <p>Not now the weakness of woman prevailed over her presence of mind,
  as we have lately seen it do in her interview with a beloved object.
  She commanded her agitation, so far as to bid for her father&#39;s
  old chair, but in vain; for her timid bidding, faltered from behind a
  crowd, failed to catch the ear of the jocular auctioneer, (who, in
  Wales, must always be somewhat of a mountebank,) and the favourite
  chair was gone at once, after the wheel, and the many old familiar
  chattels which she saw standing, now the property of strangers.</p>

  <p>Events crowded fast on each other, hurrying on that terrible hour
  in which a revolting act of self-devotion was to render even this
  domestic horror of little injury to her parents. &quot;I will buy
  &#39;daddy&#39; a better chair, or he shall have enough to buy a
  better, when I am gone,&quot; she murmured to herself. For now the
  rumour grew rife, that Mr Fitzarthur had actually landed, was daily
  expected; and, in confirmation, she received through a neighbour
  present, a letter left for her by her father, stating that he had now
  actually received, under the Nabob&#39;s own hand, a proposal of
  marriage, which the generous old man (who well knew her engagements
  to another) solemnly charged her to reject, at all hazards to
  himself. He further begged her to come quickly to the temporary place
  of refuge he and her mother had found under the roof of a hill
  cottage, just now tenantless through the death of a relative.
  Thither, with heavy heart, Winifred hastened by the first light of
  morning.</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>The</i> hill,&quot; an expression much in the mouths of
  Welsh rural people, signifies not any particular one, as it would in
  England, but the whole desolate regions of the mountain heights; the
  homeless place of ever-whistling winds, and low bellowing clouds,
  mingling with the mist of the mountain, into one black smoke-like
  rolling volume&#8212;the place of dismal pools and screaming kites,
  full of bogs, concealed by a sickly yellowish herbage in the midst of
  the russet waste, boundlessly wearying the eye with its sober
  monotony of tint. If a pool or lake relieve it by reflecting the sky,
  on approach it is found choked all round by high rushes, and shadowed
  by low strangely-shaped rocks, tinted by mosses of dingy hue; the
  water that glistened pleasantly in the distance, shrinks now to a
  mere pond, (the middle space, too deep for bullrushes and other weeds
  to take root.) The deep stillness, or the unintermitted hollow
  blowing of the wind (according to the weather) are equally mournful.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg
  106]</a></span> The rotten soil is cleft and torn into gulleys and
  small channels, in which the mahogany-coloured rivulets, springing
  from the peat morass, straggle silently with a sluggish motion in
  harmony with the lifeless scene. There, if a weedy-roofed hut do
  appear, (detected by its thin feeble smoke column) or the shepherd
  who tenants it should show his solitary figure in the distance, the
  only upright object where is not one tree-trunk, neither the home of
  man nor man&#39;s appearance lessens the sense of almost savage
  solitude; the one so lonely, not a smoke-wreath being visible all
  round, beside; the other, as he loiters by, watching some sheep on
  some distant bank, so shy and wild-looking, and, to appearance, so
  melancholy, so forlorn. Meanwhile, as we &quot;plod our weary
  way,&quot; some dip in the wavy round of olive-hued lumpish
  mountains, or an abrupt huge chasm of awful rocks, each side being
  almost perpendicular, startles the traveller with a far-down prospect
  of some sunshiny, rich, leafy, valley region, at once showing at what
  a bleak elevation he has been roaming so long, and tantalizing him
  with the contrast of that far, far off, low, luring landscape,
  rendering more irksome than before the dead, heathery desert,
  interminably undulating before, behind, and all round him.</p>

  <p>The little farm whither old Bevan had retired, stood high in such
  a desert as this, on the very verge of such a mountain-portal, (a
  <i>bwlch</i>, pronounced boolch, the Welsh call it,) an antique stone
  cottage, hanging like a nest on one of the side banks, dismal itself,
  but all that under world of pastoral pleasantness below, in full
  though dim perspective. A premature decay is always visible on these
  kind of wild, weather-beaten homes, in the torn thatch; the walls
  tinged with green, and generally propped to resist the effects of the
  powerful winds. If white-washed, which they really are, broad streaks
  of green are visible, from the frequent heavy rains, tinged by the
  mosses and weeds of the roof. The clouds, attracted by the heights,
  career on the strong blast, so low and close, as often to shut up the
  dingy human nest in a dreary day of its own, while all below is blue
  serene.</p>

  <p>To this melancholy abode, its few rustic chattels still standing
  there, left since the death of its tenant, Winifred toiled up by a
  steep, wild, but well-known track, but found not father, mother, or
  living thing, except one, so much in unison with the wild melancholy
  of the scene, as to exalt it almost to horror. This was a wretched
  idiot man, dressed in female attire, perfectly harmless, and kept, as
  a parish pauper, at an adjacent farm. He was noted for fidelity to
  any one who flattered him by some little commission. This ragged
  object presented to her the key of the padlock on the door, with the
  words &quot;gone, gone, gone!&quot; She entered, and found, to her
  surprise, excellent refreshment provided in the desolate house,
  evidently but lately deserted. But what riveted her eyes, was a
  letter to herself in the handwriting of David, but tremulously
  written, announcing his inability to keep an appointment, (one more!)
  which they had made, to part for ever&#8212;her terrible distress, it
  will be remembered, on the last occasion, deterring the young man
  from any further trial of her feelings. He further informed her that
  Mr Fitzarthur was certainly arrived, and had taken up his temporary
  abode at the pretty house by the park, designed by Lewis Lewis for
  his own residence. Moreover, she learned that her father and mother
  anxiously expected her at that house to which they had removed, but
  did not reveal that he had <i>been removed</i> in the care of two
  bailiffs, and the house named was but a resting place in his transit
  to jail.</p>

  <p>When the mind is enfeebled by repeated blows, it often happens
  that some one, which to others may appear the slightest of all,
  produces the greatest effect, its pain being quite disproportioned to
  its real importance. Thus it happened, that, amidst all her trials,
  Winifred felt the loss of her father&#39;s favourite chair as a
  crowning misery, trivial as was that loss, when hope itself was lost.
  She had identified that very humble chattel with his figure almost
  her life long. She almost expected to see the two fair hands (for,
  truth to tell, the aged steward had never worked hard) on each side,
  and the venerable kind face projected forwards from its deep concave,
  arched over that white head, to smile welcome to her even as it stood
  out <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg
  107]</a></span> on the little green. The intrusion of boy clowns, one
  after another, into its seat seemed a grievous insult to the unhappy
  owner, though absent. Yet a sad comfort rose in the thought of her
  ability to reinstate her father in all his lost comforts, through
  this terrible marriage. Then she grew impatient in her longing to
  console him by assurance of this, notwithstanding his generous wish
  that her hand should go where he knew her heart had irretrievably
  been given. But these repeated disappointments in finding the parents
  she longed to fold to her bosom, postponing this little
  gratification, (the telling him she would repurchase the old family
  chair,) now quite overcame the fortitude she had till now exhibited.
  She sate down sick at heart&#8212;turned with aversion from the
  refreshment her fatigue required, and wept bitterly. Superstition,
  and two mysterious incidents, even while she remained on the hill, if
  indeed they were more than superstition&#39;s coinage, helped to
  depress her. Just before she reached this forlorn house with the
  haggard, aged, horrid-looking idiot prowling round it, with his rags
  fluttering in the wind, she thought that the figure of the hated
  steward and spy moved along a wild path on the opposite side of that
  great mountain cleft, traversed by a noisy torrent almost the depth
  of the whole hill, near the top of which this cottage was perched.
  His being there alone was nothing marvellous, but an ominous horror
  seemed, in her mind, to hover round that man, who (as if conscious of
  some deadly evil which was through him to overwhelm her some time)
  studiously avoided direct intercourse with his victim.</p>

  <p>The second incident which might have sprung from the dwelling of
  her mind&#39;s eye on the absent features of him, who, it seemed,
  refused to meet her again, was an apparition, or what she deemed
  such, of her dear Night-harper! One of those dense flying clouds, so
  common even at moderate elevations when the mists roll down the
  hills, suddenly enveloping the lone lofty spot, left but a little
  area of a few yards for vision, a dungeon walled with fog, which kept
  circulating furiously on the blast like a great smoke, in continuous
  whirls. And through some momentary fissure in this white wall, she
  imagined the pallid and almost ghastly visage of her forsaken lover
  appeared intensely looking toward her, as she stood on the rude
  threshold, looking out on the temporary storm that had shut her up.
  Her vague apprehension of some evil arising to David, her mind&#39;s
  perpetual object, from the man she believed herself to have espied
  just before, was rarely absent from her thought. Combining the two
  appearances, she became more and more fancy-fraught, thus confined,
  as it were, in an elemental solitude of the mountain and the cloud,
  where, for the present, we leave her, to narrate the fate of her
  father.</p>

  <p>The novel calamity of arrest for debt was borne by the respectable
  old man, John Bevan, with a patience and dignity that no study of
  philosophy could have inspired. Though somewhat inactive, he felt
  that, in the honest discharge of his duty, he stood acquitted in the
  sight of God, though not in the eye of the law, of all fault, at
  least of any one meriting the terrible punishment of imprisonment. It
  was near nightfall when two emissaries of the law appeared,
  announcing that horses waited at the neighbouring inn to convey him
  to jail with the first light of morning. The poor old dame, his wife,
  was not to be pacified by the efforts of the two bailiffs, who
  executed their commission with the utmost gentleness, by order, as it
  appeared, of the Nabob himself, notwithstanding that the old
  man&#39;s stern self-denying rejection of his overture for his
  daughter&#39;s hand had determined him to let his agent proceed to
  extremities. Soothing as well as he could both her grief and her
  rage&#8212;for the latter rose unreflectingly against the mere agents
  in this grievous infliction&#8212;old Bevan smoked his pipe as usual
  to the end, and then requested permission to take a little walk only
  to the church, which stood a short way from the solitary house where
  they surprised him.</p>

  <p>&quot;You see I cannot run, for I can hardly walk with these
  rheumatics, my friend,&quot; he observed; &quot;but I have a fancy to
  visit the churchyard to-night, as it will be moonlight, and we shall
  be pretty busy in the morning. My dame is gone to bed with the good
  woman of this cottage, as I begged her to go; so pray let us walk&#8212;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg
  108]</a></span>you shall see me all the while by the moon, without
  coming into the churchyard with me.&quot;</p>

  <p>Arrived at the low stone stile, he crossed it by the help of the
  man, and proceeded alone to the tomb of his old master&#39;s grave,
  surrounded by a rail, with a yew growing inside, marking the site of
  the ancient family vault. The moon now shining clearly, the bailiff
  saw him kneel and uncover his head, which shone in its light, in the
  distance resembling a scull bleached by the wind. He remained a long
  time in this position, and his murmuring voice was partly audible to
  the man. At last he returned, thanking him for his patience, and
  shaking him very cordially by the hand. So touched was even this
  rugged lower limb of the law by this proof of his affectionate
  remembrance of his old patron, that he behaved throughout with great
  courtesy, and even respect. Bevan and his departed master had lived,
  as has been said, almost on the footing of cronies, a certain
  phlegmatic ease of nature being the characteristic of both. So proud,
  indeed, was Bevan of his brotherlike intercourse with the great man,
  that he made himself for years almost a personal <i>fac-simile</i> of
  him, even to the cut and colour of his coat, wig, everything; and
  being a fine specimen of a &quot;noble peasant,&quot; externally as
  well as internally, his assumption of the <i>squire</i> in costume
  well became his tall figure, mild countenance, (streaked with the
  lingering pink of his youthful bloom,) and gentle demeanour. A rigid
  observer might have thought, that to this indulgent but indolent
  master the poor steward owed his ruin; his habits of
  &quot;forgiving&quot; his tenants their rent debts so often, having
  extended themselves to the former, further increased by the strange
  inattention of the new landlord. The gratitude of Bevan was, however,
  deserved&#8212;for never was a kinder master.</p>

  <p>&quot;It is a thing not to be thought,&quot; he said, while
  returning with the man, &quot;that I shall ever come back here, to
  the old church again, alive or dead; seeing that I am too poor for
  any one to bring my old bones all the way from Cardigan, to put them
  in the same ground with <i>his</i>, as I did dream of in my better
  days, and too old for a man used to free air and the hill-sides all
  his life, to live long in a prison, or indeed out of one&#8212;but we
  must all die. I assure you, my honest man and kind, you have done me
  good, in mind and body, by letting me take leave of his honour! Well
  I may call him so, now he is in heaven, whom I did honour when here,
  from my very heart of hearts; kind he was to me&#8212;a second father
  to my child&#8212;God bless him! Sure I am, if he were still among
  us, how his good heart would melt, how it would <i>bleed</i> for
  us&#8212;for <i>her</i>&#8212;I <i>know</i> it would.&quot; Here the
  old man sobbed and kept silence a space, then
  proceeded&#8212;&quot;You see how weak old age and over-love of this
  world make a man, sir. Yet I am content. Next to God, I owe to him
  whose dear corpse I have just now been so near, a long and happy
  life,&#8212;thanks, thanks, thanks! To both, up yonder, I do here
  render them from my inmost soul;&quot; and he bared his head again,
  looking up to the placid moon with a visage of kindred placidity, and
  an eye of blue lustre, so brightened by his emotion as almost to be
  likened to the heaven in which that moon shone. &quot;Why should I
  repine, or fear the walls of a prison, as my passage to that wide
  glorious world without wall or bound or end, where I hope to live
  free and for ever, in the sight of my Redeemer, and, perhaps, of him
  who was Hugh Fitzarthur, Esq., of Tallylynn hall, when here? I hope I
  am not irreverent, but in truth, friend, I fear I have almost as
  vehemently longed for the presence of him once more, as for that more
  awful presence: heaven pardon me if it was wicked! So welcome prison,
  welcome death! Half a hundred and nineteen years spent pleasantly on
  these green hills, free, and fresh, and hale, I can surely afford a
  few weeks or months to a closer place, were it but as in a school for
  my poor earthly and ignorant soul, to purify itself, to prepare
  itself for that glorious place, to learn to die.&quot;</p>

  <p>Next morning the old couple, dame Bevan being mounted on a pillion
  behind him, proceeded on their melancholy journey. They reached the
  house by the park, where it was proposed that an interview should
  take place between the old man and the landlord himself, with some
  view to arrangement prior to his imprisonment. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> While
  they there expect the long delayed comfort of Winifred&#39;s embrace,
  let us return to that good daughter, now more eager to fly to that
  dreaded suitor, to reverse her father&#39;s resolve, to offer herself
  a victim, than ever she had been to reach that dearer one who had now
  cruelly disappointed her in the hope of one more meeting&#8212;that,
  perhaps, the last she could have innocently allowed!</p>

  <p>The dreaded day of trial arrived. But we must revert to her sad
  meditations, and wild irresolute thoughts, while shut up by the
  storm-cloud, and alone, in the mountain house. Doating passion, pain
  of heart, terrible suggestions of despair, kept altering her
  countenance as she leaned against the mouldering door-post,
  imprisoned by the black mists that prevented her safely leaving the
  hovel. A sudden, dire, revolution in her religious impressions was
  wrought, or rather completed, in that dismal scene. David had more
  than once wrung her very soul by dark hints of self-destruction in
  the event of her ever forsaking him. He had thus been led into
  discussions on suicide, and had even argued for the moral right of
  man to end his own being under circumstances. Persuasion hangs on the
  lips of those we love. What she would have rejected as impious, from
  some immoral man, in dispute, sank deep into her soul, emanating from
  a heart she loved, through lips that, to her, seemed formed for
  eloquence as much as love to make its throne.</p>

  <p>Wild and tragical modes of reconciling her two furious, fighting,
  irreconcilable wishes&#8212;that of saving her father&#8212;that of
  blessing her lover&#8212;began to take terrible form and reality in
  her mind, as the wind howled, the ruinous house shook, and its
  timbers groaned, and the blackness of the sky, as the storm
  increased, deepened the lurid hue of the foul and turbulent fog, (for
  such the mountain cloud thus in contact with her eyes appeared.) The
  world, as it were, already left behind, or rather below, the elements
  alone warring round her, her high-wrought imagination began to regard
  life and death, and the world itself, as things no longer
  appertaining to her, except as a passive instrument toward one great
  object, the preservation of her father&#39;s freedom, and, if it
  <i>were</i> possible, also of her own inviolate person&#8212;that
  person which she had, indeed, most solemnly vowed to one alone, David
  the Telynwr. Not <i>to</i> him&#8212;for her innate delicacy rendered
  such vows repugnant to her; but alone, by the moon or stars, by the
  cataract, and in the lonely lanes and woods, she had vowed herself to
  one alone&#8212;had dedicated her virgin beauty (in the spirit of
  those romances she had fatally devoured) to her
  &quot;night-harper&quot; with as true devotion as ever did white
  vestal, at the end of her noviciate, devote herself alive and dead to
  the one God. Instilled by the touching tone, the wild pathos, the
  swimming eye of a wayward passionate character, weak, yet bold, of
  whom she knew almost nothing, this devoted girl yielded up her better
  reason to his rash innovations in morals, his examples of suicidal
  heroes, and even <i>moralists</i>, among the ancients; and in the
  wild height, alone, among the clouds, she almost wrought up her fond
  agonizing soul to a terrible part&#8212;the accomplishing her
  father&#39;s preservation, <i>on her wedding-day</i>, through the
  influence she might naturally expect to obtain in such a season, and
  that done, make her peace with God; and, before night&#8212;black
  pools&#8212;rock precipices, fearful as Leucadia&#39;s&#8212;mortal
  plants, and even the horrid knife and halter&#8212;floated before her
  mind&#39;s eye without her trembling, even like terrible, yet kind,
  ministrants proffering escape&#8212;escape from legalised
  violation!&#8212;escape from <i>perjury</i>, to her, the self-doomed
  Iphigenia! For her morbid fancy, whispered to by her intense
  tenderness, conjured up that dilemma between faith broken to her
  lover and abandonment of a dear parent to his fate. Despair suggested
  that self-destruction itself might seem venial, even before God, when
  rushed upon as the only alternative to perjury&#8212;to prostitution;
  for such her romantic purity taught her to consider submission to the
  embrace of any living man except her heart&#39;s own&#8212;her
  affianced&#8212;&quot;her beautiful!&quot;&#8212;her lost!</p>

  <p>Such were the feelings under whose influence our humble heroine
  pursued her mountain journey, of a few miles, to the place of meeting
  with her parents; and it was probably beneath the roof of the lone
  cottage in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id=
  "Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> cloud that, under the same morbid mood
  of mind, she penned a letter to Mr Fitzarthur, which was afterwards
  discovered, dated at top &quot;My Wedding Day,&quot; containing a
  passionate appeal on behalf of her father, for a bond of legal
  indemnification to be executed before night, as a present which she
  had set her heart on giving her father, as a bridal one, <i>that very
  day</i>. Arrived at the house fitted up for the hated supplanter of
  her father, &quot;Lewis the Spy,&quot; her heart beat so violently
  before she could firm her nerves to ring the bell, that she stood
  leaning some time against the wall. This old house was now almost
  rebuilt, and not without regard to rural beauty, in harmony with the
  fine scenery of an antique park, with its mossy ivied remains of
  walls and venerable trees overshadowing it, and was called &quot;The
  Little Hall of the Park.&quot; She sighed deeply as she glanced at
  its comfortable aspect, remembering how long it had formed the secret
  object of her mother&#39;s little ambition (for the dame had a touch
  of pride in her composition beyond her ever-contented mate) to occupy
  that <i>little</i> hall. It seemed so appropriate that the lesser
  squire&#8212;the <i>great</i> squire&#39;s friend&#8212;should also
  have <i>his</i> &quot;hall,&quot; though a little one!</p>

  <p>Indeed, it had been in incipient repair for him, that the old men
  might spend their winter evenings together at the real hall, divided
  but by a short path, across an angle of the park, without a dreary
  walk for Bevan impending over the end of their carouse, with
  never-wearied reminiscences of their boyhood&#8212;when sudden death
  stopped all proceedings, and left poor Bevan alone in the world, as
  it seemed to him&#8212;&quot;in simplicity a child,&quot; and as
  imbecile in conflict with it as any child.</p>

  <p>She nerved her mind and hand by an effort, and rang the
  bell&#8212;(the <i>bell</i>, there a modern innovation.) No sound but
  its own distant deadened one, was heard within; but some dog in the
  rear barked, and then howled, as if alarmed at the sudden breach of
  long prevailing silence. Again she rang&#8212;again the troubled
  growl and bark, suppressed by fear of the only living thing, as it
  seemed, within hearing, alone responded. The situation was very
  solitary, the only adjacent house, the hall, being yet tenantless,
  and night was gathering fast; for that storm which had first detained
  her in the lofty region, (where a darker storm had gathered round her
  mind and soul,) had desolated the lower country all day, flooded the
  brooks, and delayed her on the road during several hours.</p>

  <p>She fancied a sort of suppressed commotion within, as of
  whisperings and stealthy steps, and one voice she clearly overheard,
  but it was not her father&#39;s. Whether it was that of Lewis (who,
  however, was not yet residing there) she knew not, never having heard
  it in her life; he avoiding, as was stated, direct intercourse with
  her&#8212;disappearing &quot;like a guilty thing&quot; whenever her
  figure appeared in distant approach. What should this mean? Wild
  fears, even superstitious ones, of some indefinite ill or horror
  impending, began to shake her forced fortitude, as she stood,
  half-fearing to ring again&#8212;again to hear the melancholy voice
  of the dog, as of one lost&#8212;to wait&#8212;listen&#8212;and dream
  of&#8212;David&#8212;death&#8212;murder&#8212;or even worse, till
  even the giant horror&#8212;the jail!&#8212;and the white-headed
  prisoner, shrank before the present ominous mystery&#8212;ominous of
  she <i>knew</i> not what, therefore involving every thing dreadful.
  Meanwhile, the swinging of the large oak branches in the close of a
  squally day, their groaning, and the vast glooms that their foliage
  shed all below, the twilight rapidly deepening into confirmed night,
  all tended to the inspiration of a wild unearthly melancholy.
  Suddenly the door was opened, while she hesitated to ring again, and
  by a <i>black</i> man! Persons of colour are rarely seen inland, in
  Wales, and Winifred had never visited a seaport of any consequence;
  so that even this was almost a shock. She quickly, however, guessed
  that this was a servant of the &quot;Nabob,&quot; brought over with
  him. The man, learning her name, bade her enter, adding, that she
  would see her father <i>soon</i>, but that &quot;massa&quot; was
  within, settling some affairs with Mr Lewis, and begged to see her. A
  sort of grim grin, though joined to a deference that seemed, to her
  troubled and broken spirit, and sunken heart, a cruel mockery,
  relaxed the man&#39;s features, and half shocked, half irritated her.
  Her spirits, however, rose with the occasion, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
  demanding all her fortitude and all her tact; for now she was to make
  that impression on this terrible suitor&#39;s fancy, through which
  alone she could work out her father&#39;s salvation. In a few minutes
  more, she stood in the same apartment with her David&#39;s detested
  rival! The embers of a large fire, decayed, cast red twilight, which
  made it appear already dark without; and there he stood, at the long
  room&#39;s extreme end, between her and the hearth.</p>

  <p>To Winifred, the personal attributes of the man, whom in her awful
  resolve she regarded merely as the instrument of that filial good
  work, were utterly indifferent; yet she stopped&#8212;she
  shuddered&#8212;and trembled all over, as she caught the mere outline
  of his figure by the fire-light. There he was! to her idea, the
  embodied evil genius of her family! the sullen apostate from the
  finer part of love&#8212;the victim of satiety, (as rumour said,) the
  selfish contemner of women&#39;s better feelings!&#8212;indifferent
  to all but person in his election of a wife; willing to unite himself
  with one whose heart and mind were stranger to him, on bare report of
  her health and beauty, and some slight recollections of her
  childhood! Seeing her stop, and even totter, he advanced a few steps;
  but she, with the instinctive recoil and antipathy of some feeble
  creature from its natural enemy, retreated at his first
  movement&#8212;and, shocked by this betrayed repugnance, he again
  stood irresolute. Then rushed back upon her heart, with all the
  horror of novelty, the renunciation of poor David, now it was on the
  point of being sealed for ever. Now father, mother, all beside, was
  forgotten&#8212;the ghastliness of a terrible struggle within, the
  stern horror of confirmed despair, began to disguise her beauty as
  with a death-pale mask&#8212;the features grew rigid, her heart beat
  audibly, her ears rang and tingled, and sight grew dim. She was
  fainting, falling. Mr Fitzarthur sprang to support her, but putting
  his arms too boldly round her waist, that detested freedom at once
  startled her into temporary self-possession, back into life. She
  gasped, struggled against him, as if she had rather have fallen than
  have been supported by <i>him</i>; and turned to him that white face,
  white even to the lips, imploringly, where was still depicted her
  unconquerable aversion. Some astonishment seemed to rivet that look
  upon his face, but half-visible by the dusky light&#8212;astonishment
  no longer painful, when the Nabob, emboldened, renewed his now
  permitted clasp, and only uttering &quot;My <i>dear</i>! don&#39;t
  you know me?&quot; in the tenderest tone to which ever manly voice
  was modulated, increased his grasp to a passionate embrace, advanced
  his face&#8212;his mouth to hers, advanced and pressed
  unresisted&#8212;and before her bewildered eyes closed in that
  fainting fit which had been but suspended, stood revealed to them (as
  proved by one delighted smile, flashed out of all the settled gloom
  of that countenance,) as her heart&#39;s own David&#8212;no longer
  the night&#8212;wandering poor <i>Telynwr</i>, but David Fitzarthur
  of Talylynn, Esq.</p>

  <p>The story of the eccentric East Indian may be shortly told. From
  childhood he was the victim of excessive morbid sensibility, and
  constitutional melancholy. The jovial habits of his good-natured
  Welsh uncle were repugnant to his nature; and after becoming an
  orphan, the solitary boy had no human object on which the deep
  capacity for tenderness of his <i>occult</i> nature could be exerted.
  Thus forced by his fate into solitariness of habits, and secreted
  emotions, he was deemed unsocial, and reproached for what he felt was
  his misfortune&#8212;the being wholly misunderstood by those his
  early lot was cast among. Hence his perverted ardour of affection was
  misplaced on the lower living world&#8212;dog, cat, or owl, whatever
  chance made his companions. Returning to India, where he had known
  two parents, to meet no longer the tenderness of even one, the
  melancholy boy-exile (for Wales he ever regarded as his country)
  increased in morbid estrangement from mankind, as he increased in
  years; till his maturity nearly realized the misanthropic unsocial
  character for which his youth had been unjustly reproached. Though in
  the high road to a splendid fortune, he loathed East Indian society,
  far beyond all former loathing of fox-hunters and topers in Wales,
  whose green mountains now became (conformably to the nature,
  &quot;<i>semper varium et mutabile</i>,&quot; of the melancholic) the
  very idols of his romantic regrets and <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> fondest memory. In India
  were neither green fields nor green hearts. External nature and human
  nature appeared equally to languish under that enfeebling hot death
  in the atmosphere, which seemed to wither female beauty in the moment
  that it ripened. The pallidness of the European beauties, sickly as
  the clime, disgusted him&#8212;their venality still more. Female
  fortune-hunters were far more intolerable to his delicacy than the
  coarsest hunter of vermin&#8212;fox or hare&#8212;ever had been at
  his uncle&#39;s hall, whom he began to esteem, and sincerely
  mourned&#8212;when death had removed all of him from his memory but
  his kindness, his desire to amuse him, the &quot;sulky boy,&quot; his
  substantial goodness and warm-heartedness. Knowing that every female
  in his circle was well informed of his ample fortune, still
  accumulating, he fancied art, deceit, coquetry in every smile and
  glance, (for suspicion of human hearts and motives ever besets the
  melancholic character;) and thus, it was natural that he should
  sometimes sigh over the idea of some fresh mountain beauty, not
  trained by parents in the art and to the task of husband-hunting.
  Even the soft-faced child, just growing into woman, who had held her
  pinafore for fruit, in the orchard, whose half-fallen apple-tree was
  his almost constant seat, floated across his vacant, yet restless
  mind. In truth, when she surprised him in his part of sexton to his
  owl, she had evinced rather more sympathy than she had admitted to
  his other self, David the wood-wanderer; and though she had indeed
  laughed, it was with tears in her eyes, elicited by one she detected
  in the shy averted orbs of his. Yet was the sweetness of the little
  Welsh girl left behind, for a long time, even when manhood failed to
  banish its idea, no more than his statue to Pygmalion, or his watery
  image to Narcissus. But having no female society, save those
  marketable forms that he distrusted and despised; yet pining, in his
  romantic refinement, for <i>pure</i> passion&#8212;for reciprocal
  passion&#8212;panting to be loved <i>for himself alone</i>, he kept
  imagining her developed graces, exaggerating the conceit of some
  childish tenderness toward himself, his position and his nervous
  infirmity keeping a solitude of soul and heart ever round him, into
  which no female form had free and constant admission, but that aÃ«rial
  one, the little Winifred, of far, far off, green Wales! The promise
  of pure beauty, which her childhood gave, his <i>dream</i> fulfilled;
  and his imagination seized and cherished the beautiful cloud, painted
  by fancy, till it became the goddess of his idolatry, though
  conscious of the self-delusion, and retained with that tenacity
  conceivable, perhaps, to the morbidly sensitive alone. The habit of
  yielding to the importunity of one idea, strengthens itself; every
  recurrence of it produces quicker sensibility to the next; deeper and
  deeper impression follows, till one form of mania
  supervenes&#8212;that which consists in the undue mastery and eternal
  presence of one idea.</p>

  <p>Childish and <i>fugitive</i> as it <i>seemed</i>, a passion had
  actually commenced in his <i>boy&#39;s</i> heart, which clung to that
  of the man, though under the same light, fragile, and dreamlike form.
  Poetry might liken it to the mere frothy foam of the infant cataract,
  when it gushes out of the breast of the mountain to the rising sun,
  which, arrested by an intense frost, ere it can fall, in the very act
  of evanishing, there hangs, still hangs, the mere air-bubbles
  congealed into crystal vesicles, defying all the force of the mounted
  sun to dissipate their delicate white beauty, evanescent as it
  <i>looks</i>. The chill and the impenetrability of heart, kept by
  circumstances within him, such frost might typify&#8212;that pure,
  fragile-seeming, yet durable passion, that snow-foam of the
  waterfall. True it was that this fantastic fancy had the power to
  draw him to his Welsh patrimony earlier than worldly ambition would
  have warranted. But his after conduct&#8212;his actual overtures were
  not so wildly romantic, as might appear from the foregoing narrative;
  but of this in the sequel.</p>

  <p>And where was her father&#8212;mother? Why had the law been
  allowed by this eccentric lover to violate the humble sanctuary of
  home, at the desolate Llaneol? What was become of the wicker chair?
  Was the hated Lewis to be maintained in his usurpation of the chair
  of Bevan&#39;s <i>ancestral</i> post of steward, (for his father had
  been steward to the father of the squire deceased?) Above all, was
  Dame Bevan to see that home of her heart&#39;s hope, the permanent
  home <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg
  113]</a></span> of the harsh supplanter of her husband? Passing over
  the affecting scene of poor Winifred&#39;s fainting, which drew round
  her father and mother, and others from below, proceed we to answer
  those queries and conclude our tale.</p>

  <p>When perfectly restored, Winifred, leaning on the arm of her
  future husband, accompanied her parents down into the comfortable
  kitchen, where, by a huge fire, stood the veritable wicker chair,
  familiar to her eyes from infancy, rickety as ever, but surviving its
  desecration by the boys at the auction; and looking round, she saw
  standing the whole solid old oaken furniture, coffers, dressers,
  &amp;c., even to the same bright brazen skillets, pewter dishes, and
  sundries&#8212;the pride of Mistress Bevan&#39;s heart, the splendour
  of better days. Mr Fitzarthur led the old man by the hand to his own
  chair, his wife to another; and then, having seated himself by their
  daughter, began, over the fumes of tea and coffee, (the honours of
  which pleasant meal, so needful after her agitation, he solicited
  Winifred to perform,) to narrate various matters, which we must
  condense into a nutshell.</p>

  <p>To their surprise and amusement, they now learned that the hated
  &quot;spy&quot; who had prowled round their folds and fields so long,
  would resign to Mistress Bevan the house in which they sat, and that
  atonement made, vanish into thin air&#8212;<i>a vox et preterea
  nihil!</i> being in reality the Proteus-like, mysterious, handsome,
  though sallow stranger, and no stranger, sitting among them!</p>

  <p>We said that Mr Fitzarthur&#39;s conduct in espousing this
  long-unseen mistress of his fancy, was not quite so extraordinary and
  wild as it appeared. For coming back grown into maturity, and altered
  by climate in complexion and all characteristics, he found himself
  quite unrecognised, and conceived the idea of at once reconnoitring
  his dilapidated estate, and watching the conduct of his
  long-remembered Winifred. <i>Two</i> disguises seemed necessary
  toward these two purposes, and he adopted the two we have seen, one
  on the &quot;hither side Tivy,&quot; the other on the &quot;far side
  Tivy,&quot; which his coracle allowed him to cross at pleasure. His
  close watch of the blameless girl&#39;s whole life confirmed the warm
  and romantic wishes of his soul, which her beauty inspired&#8212;that
  beauty as fully confirming the vision of his love-dream when far and
  long away.</p>

  <p>It was during the alarm of her prolonged fainting, produced by the
  surprise of this discovery, and the previous agitations, (whereby,
  perhaps, the prudence rather than the affection of the eccentric
  lover was impeached,) that her mother, searching her pocket for a
  bottle of volatile salts, turned forth the letter lately referred to,
  melancholy evidence of the desperate extremity to which two powerful
  antagonist passions&#8212;love, and filial love&#8212;had driven a
  mind not unfortified by religion, but beleaguered by despair and all
  its powers, till resolution failed, and peril impended over an
  otherwise almost spotless soul.</p>

  <p>As the old man&#39;s affections were not wholly weaned from
  Llaneol, ruinous as it was, his son-in-law had it restored as a
  temporary summer residence for the old people, as well as
  occasionally for himself and his beloved bride.</p>

  <p>It hardly needs to be told, that the arrest and its executors were
  but parts of the delusion, the amount of real infliction being no
  more than a ride in a fine morning of some miles. Whether the whole,
  as involving some little added trouble of mind to that whose whole
  weight he was going so soon to remove, was too severe a penance for
  the steward&#39;s neglect, may be variously judged by various
  readers. In the halcyon days that followed, Winifred never forgot the
  place on the Tivy bank where she slept and dropped her book; nor did
  the happy husband, melancholic no more, forsake his coracle or his
  harp utterly, but would often serenade his lady-love (albeit his
  wedded love also) on some golden evening, as she sat among the
  cowslips and harebells, that enamelled with floral blue and gold the
  greensward bank of the Tivy, under the fine sycamore tree&#8212;the
  &quot;trysting-place&quot; of their romantic assignations.</p>

  <h3>NO. VI.<br />
  SUPPLEMENT TO DRYDEN ON CHAUCER.</h3>.

  <p>From the grand achievements of Glorious John, one experiences a
  queer revulsion of the currency in the veins in passing to the small
  doings of Messrs Betterton, Ogle, and Co., in 1737 and 1741; and
  again, to the still smaller of Mr Lipscomb in 1795, in the way of
  modernizations of Chaucer. Who was Mr Betterton, nobody, we presume,
  now knows; assuredly he was not Pope, though there is something silly
  to that effect in Joseph Warton, which is repeated by Malone.
  &quot;Mr Harte assured me,&quot; saith Dr Joseph, &quot;that he was
  convinced by some circumstances which Fenton had communicated to him,
  that Pope wrote the characters that make the introduction (the
  Prologue) to the Canterbury Tales, published under the name of
  Betterton.&quot; Betterton is bitter bad; Ogle, &quot;<i>wersh</i> as
  cauld parritch without sawte!&quot; Lipscomb is a jewel. In a
  postscript to his preface he says, &quot;I have barely time here, the
  tales being already almost all printed off, to apologize to the
  reader for having inserted my own translation of The Nun&#39;s
  Priest&#39;s Tale, instead of that of Dryden; but the fact is, <i>I
  did not know that Dryden&#39;s version existed</i>; for having
  undertaken to complete those of the Canterbury Tales which were
  wanting in Ogle&#39;s collection, and the tale in question <i>not
  being in that collection</i>, I proceeded to supply it, having never
  till very lately, strange as it may seem, <i>seen the volume of
  Dryden&#39;s Fables in which it may be found</i>!!&quot;</p>

  <p>It is diverting to hear the worthy who, in 1795, had never seen
  Dryden&#39;s Fables, offering to the public the first completed
  collection of the Canterbury Tales in a modern version, &quot;under
  the reasonable confidence that the improved taste in poetry, and the
  extended cultivation of that, in common with all the other elegant
  arts, which so strongly characterizes the present day, will make the
  lovers of verse look up to the old bard, the father of English
  poetry, with a veneration proportioned to the improvements they have
  made in it.&quot; It grieves him to think that the language in which
  Chaucer wrote &quot;has decayed from under him.&quot; That reason
  alone, he says, can justify the attempt of exhibiting him in a modern
  dress; and he tells us that so faithfully has he adhered to the great
  original, that they who have not given their time to the study of the
  old language, &quot;must either find a true likeness of Chaucer
  exhibited in this version, or they will find it nowhere else.&quot;
  With great solemnity he says, &quot;Thence I have imposed it on
  myself as a duty somewhat sacred to deviate from my original as
  little as possible in the sentiment, and have often in the language
  adopted his own expressions, the simplicity and effect of which have
  always forcibly struck me, <i>wherever the terms he uses (and that
  happens not unfrequently) are intelligible to modern ears</i>.&quot;
  Yes&#8212;Gulielme Lipscomb, thou wert indeed a jewel.</p>

  <p>Happy would he have been to accompany his version of Chaucer with
  notes. &quot;But though the version itself has been an agreeable and
  easy rural occupation, yet in a remote village, near 250 miles from
  London, the very books, <i>trifling as they may seem</i>, to which it
  would be necessary to refer <i>to illustrate</i> <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> <i>the
  manners of the 14th century</i>, were not to be procured; and
  parochial and other engagements would not admit of absence sufficient
  to consult them where they are to be found; it is not therefore for
  want of deference to the opinions of those who have recommended a
  body of notes that they do not accompany these Tales.&quot;
  Yes&#8212;Gulielme, thou wert a jewel.</p>

  <p>It is, however, but too manifest from his alleged versions, that
  not only did Mr Lipscomb of necessity eschew the perusal of &quot;the
  books, trifling as they may seem, to which it would be necessary to
  refer to illustrate the manners of the 14th century,&quot; but that
  he continued to his dying day almost as ignorant of Chaucer&#39;s
  Canterbury Tales as of Dryden&#39;s Fables.</p>

  <p>In his preface he tells one very remarkable falsehood. &quot;The
  Life of Chaucer, and the Introductory Discourse to the Canterbury
  Tales, are taken from the valuable edition of his original works
  published by Mr Tyrwhitt.&quot; The Introductory Discourse is so
  taken; but it is plain that poor, dear, fibbing Willy Lipscomb had
  not looked into it, for it contradicts throughout all the statements
  in the life of Chaucer, which is not from Tyrwhitt, but clumsily
  cribbed piecemeal by Willy himself from that rambling and inaccurate
  one by a Mr Thomas in Urry&#39;s edition. Lipscomb is lying on our
  table, and we had intended to quote a few specimens of him and his
  predecessor Ogle; but another volume that had fallen aside a year or
  two ago, has of itself mysteriously reappeared&#8212;and a few words
  of it in preference to other &quot;haverers.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mr Horne, the author of &quot;The False Medium,&quot;
  &quot;Orion,&quot; the &quot;Spirit of the Age,&quot; and some other
  clever brochures in prose and in verse, in the laboured rather than
  elaborate introduction to &quot;The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer,
  modernized,&quot; (1841,) by Leigh Hunt, Wordsworth, Robert Bell,
  Thomas Powell, Elizabeth Barrett, and Zachariah Azed, gives us some
  threescore pages on Chaucer&#39;s versification; but, though they
  have an imposing air at first sight, on inspection they prove
  stark-naught. He seems to have a just enough general notion of the
  principle of the verse in the Canterbury Tales; but with the many
  ways of its working&#8212;the how, the why, and the
  wherefore&#8212;he is wholly unacquainted, though he dogmatizes like
  a doctor. He soon makes his escape from the real difficulties with
  which the subject is beset, and mouths away at immense length and
  width about what he calls &quot;the <i>secret</i> of Chaucer&#39;s
  rhythm in his heroic verse, which has been the baffling subject of so
  much discussion among scholars, a trifling increase in the syllables
  occasionally introduced for variety, and founded upon the same laws
  of contraction by apostrophe, syncope, &amp;c., as those followed by
  all modern poets; but employed in a more free and varied manner, all
  the words being fully written out, the vowels sounded, and not
  subjected to the disruption of inverted commas, as used in after
  times.&quot; This &quot;secret&quot; was patent to all the world
  before Mr Horne took pen in hand, and his eternal blazon of it is too
  much now for ears of flesh and blood. The modernized versions,
  however, are respectably executed&#8212;Leigh Hunt&#39;s admirably;
  and we hope for another volume. But Mr Horne himself must be more
  careful in his future modernizations. The very opening of the
  Prologue is not happy.</p>

  <p>In Chaucer it runs thus:&#8212;</p>

  <p>Look back to Chaucer&#39;s own lines, and you will see that Mr
  Horne&#39;s variations are all for the worse. How flat and tame
  &quot;sweet April showers,&quot; in comparison with &quot;April with
  his shourÃ¨s sote.&quot; In Chaucer the month comes boldly on, in his
  own person&#8212;in Mr Horne he is diluted into his own showers.
  &#39;Tis ominous thus to stumble on the threshold. &quot;Downward
  shoot&quot; is very bad indeed in itself, and all unlike the natural
  strength of Chaucer. &quot;Liquid power&quot; is even worse and more
  unlike; and most tautological the &quot;virtue of power.&quot; In
  Chaucer the virtue is in the &quot;licour.&quot; &quot;Rare&quot; is
  poorly dropped in to fill up. Chaucer purposely uses &quot;sotÃ¨&quot;
  twice&#8212;and the repetition tells. Mr Horne must needs change it
  into &quot;fragrant.&quot; &quot;In the trees&quot; is not in
  Chaucer&#8212;for he knew that &quot;smalÃ¨ foulÃ¨s&quot; shelter in
  the &quot;hethe&quot; as well as in the &quot;holt&quot;&#8212;among
  broom and bracken, and heath and rushes. Chaucer does not <i>say</i>,
  as Mr Horne does, that the birds <i>dream</i>&#8212;he leaves you to
  think for yourself whether they do so or not, while sleeping with
  open eye all night. Such conjectural emendations are injurious to
  Chaucer. We presume Mr Horne believes he has authority for applying
  &quot;so pricketh hem nature in hire corages&quot; to the folks that
  &quot;longen to go on pilgrimages&quot;&#8212;and not to the
  &quot;smalÃ¨ foulÃ¨s.&quot; Or is it intended for a happy innovation?
  To us it seems an unhappy blunder&#8212;taking away a fine touch of
  nature from Chaucer, and hardening it into horn; while &quot;all
  energies and ages&quot; is indeed a free and affected version of
  &quot;corages.&quot; &quot;For to wander thro&#39;,&quot; is a
  mistranslation of &quot;to seken;&quot; and to &quot;sing the holy
  mass,&quot; is not the meaning of to &quot;servÃ¨ halwes couthe,&quot;
  <i>i.e.</i> to worship saints known, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Turning over a couple of leaves, we behold a modernization of the
  antique with a vengeance&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;His son, a young squire, with him there I
      <i>saw</i>,</span> <span class="i2">A lover and a lusty
      bache<i>lor</i>! (aw) (ah!)</span> <span class="i2">With locks
      crisp curl&#39;d, as they&#39;d been laid in press,</span>
      <span class="i2">Of twenty year of age he was, I
      guess.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer never once in all his writings thus rhymes off two
  consecutive couplets in one sentence so slovenly, as with &quot;I
  saw,&quot; and &quot;I guess.&quot; But Mr Horne is so enamoured
  &quot;with the old familiar faces&quot; of pet cockneyisms, that he
  must have his will of them. Of the same squire, Chaucer
  says&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Of his stature he was of <i>even
      length</i>;&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and Mr Horne translates the words into&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;He was in stature of the common
      length,&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>They mean &quot;well proportioned.&quot; Of this young squire,
  Chaucer saith&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;So hote he loved, that by
      nightertale</span> <span class="i2">He slep no more than doth the
      nightingale.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We all know how the nightingale employs the night&#8212;and here
  it is implied that so did the lover. Mr Horne spoils all by an
  affected prettiness suggested by a misapplied passage in Milton.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;His amorous ditties nightly fill&#39;d the
      vale;</span> <span class="i2">He slept no more than doth the
      nightingale.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer says of the Prioresse&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Full well she sang the servicÃ¨
      divine</span> <span class="i2">EntunÃ¨d in hire nose ful
      swetÃ¨ly.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr Horne must needs say&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Entuned in her nose with <i>accent</i>
      sweet.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The accent, to our ears, is lost in the pious snivel&#8212;pardon
  the somewhat unclerical word.</p>

  <p>Chaucer says of her&#8212;-</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Ful semÃ¨ly after hire meat she
      raught,&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>which Mr Horne improves into&#8212;-</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span style="margin-left: 10em;">&quot;And for her meat</span>
      <span class="i2">Full seemly bent she forward on her
      seat.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer says&#8212;</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117"
  id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;<i>And peined hire</i> to contrefeten
      chere</span> <span class="i2">Of court, and been astatelich of
      manere,</span> <span class="i2">And to be holden digne of
      reverence.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That is, she took pains to imitate the manners of the Court,
  &amp;c.; whereas Mr Horne, with inconceivable ignorance of the
  meaning of words that occur in Chaucer a hundred times, writes
  &quot;<i>it gave her pain</i> to counterfeit the ways of Court,&quot;
  thereby reversing the whole picture.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;And French she spake full fayre and
      fetisly,&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>he translates &quot;full properly <i>and neat</i>!&quot; Dryden
  rightly calls her &quot;the mincing Prioress;&quot; Mr Horne wrongly
  says, &quot;she was evidently one of the most high-bred and refined
  ladies of her time.&quot;</p>

  <p>Chaucer says, of that &quot;manly man,&quot; the Monk&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Ne that a monk, when he is
      rekkeless,</span> <span class="i2">Is like to a fish that is
      waterless;</span> <span class="i2">This is to say, a monk out of
      his cloistre.</span> <span class="i2">This ilkÃ¨ text held he not
      worth an oistre.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr Horne here modernizeth thus&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Or that a monk beyond his bricks and
      <i>mortar</i>,</span> <span class="i2">Is like a fish without a
      drop of <i>water</i>,</span> <span class="i2">That is to say, a
      monk out of his cloister.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There can be no mortar without water, but the words do not rhyme
  except to Cockney ears, though the blame lies at the door of the
  mouth. &quot;Bricks and mortar&quot; is an odd and somewhat vulgar
  version of &quot;rekkeless;&quot; and to say that a monk &quot;beyond
  his bricks and mortar&quot; is a monk &quot;out of his
  cloister,&quot; is not in the manner of Chaucer, or of any body
  else.</p>

  <p>Chaucer says slyly of the Frere, that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;He hadde ymade ful mony a mariage</span>
      <span class="i2">Of yongÃ¨ women, at his owen coste;&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and Mister Horne brazen-facedly,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Full many a marriage had he brought to
      bear,</span> <span class="i2">For women young, and <i>paid the
      cost with sport</i>.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>O fie, Mister Horne! To hide our blushes, will no maiden for a
  moment lend us her fan? We cover our face with our hands.&#8212;Of
  this same Frere, Mr Horne, in his introduction, when exposing the
  faults of another translator, says that &quot;Chaucer shows us the
  quaint begging rogue playing his harp among a crowd of admiring
  auditors, and <i>turning up his eyes</i> with an attempted expression
  of religious enthusiasm;&quot; but Chaucer does no such thing, nor
  was the Frere given to any such practice.</p>

  <p>Of the Clerk of Oxenford, Chaucer says, he &quot;loked holwe, and
  thereto soberly.&quot; Mr Horne needlessly adds &quot;ill-fed.&quot;
  Chaucer says&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Ful threadbare was his overest
      courtepy.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr Horne modernizes it into&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;His uppermost short cloak <i>was a bare
      thread</i>.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Why exaggerate so? Chaucer says&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;But all that he might of <i>his frendes
      hente</i></span> <span class="i2">On bokÃ¨s and on lerning he it
      spente.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr Horne says&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;But every farthing that his friends
      e&#39;er <i>lent</i>.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>They did not <i>lend</i>, they gave outright to the poor
  scholar.</p>

  <p>The Reve&#39;s Prologue opens thus in Chaucer&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Whan folk han laughed at this nicÃ¨
      cas</span> <span class="i2">Of Absalom and <i>hendy</i>
      Nicholas.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr Horne says&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Of Absalom and <i>credulous</i>
      Nicholas!&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He manifestly mistakes the sly scholar for the credulous
  carpenter, whom on the tenderest point he outwitted! To those who
  know the nature of the story, the blunder is extreme.</p>

  <p>What is to be thought of such rhymes as these?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;And for to drink strong wine as red as
      <i>blood</i>,</span> <span class="i2">Then would he jest, and

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Toward the mill, the bay nag in his
      <i>hand</i>,</span> <span class="i2">The miller sitting by the

    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;And on she went, till she the cradle

  <p>These to our ears, are not happy modernizations of Chaucer.</p>

  <p>Here come a few more Cockneyisms.</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Alas! our warden&#39;s palfrey it is

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Alas! this worst of all is Elizabeth Barrett&#39;s! &quot;Well of
  English <i>undefiled</i>!&quot;</p>

  <p>In Chaucer we have&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;<span class='smcap'>A Sergeant of the
      LawÃ¨</span>, ware and wise,</span> <span class="i2">That often
      hadde yben <i>at the Parvis</i>.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr Horne gives us&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;A Sergeant of the Law, wise, wary,
      <i>arch</i>!</span> <span class="i2"><i>Who oft had gossip&#39;d
      long in the church porch.</i>&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The word &quot;arch&quot; is here interpolated to give some colour
  to the charge of &quot;gossiping,&quot; absurdly asserted of the
  learned Sergeant. The Parvis was the place of conference, where
  suitors met with their counsel and legal advisers; and Chaucer merely
  intimates thereby the extent of the Sergeant&#39;s practice. In
  Chaucer we have&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;In termÃ¨s hadde he cas and domÃ¨s
      alle</span> <span class="i2">That fro the time of <i>King
      Will.</i> weren falle.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Who does not see the propriety of the customary contraction,
  <i>King Will.</i>? Mr Horne does not; and substitutes, &quot;since
  King William&#39;s reign.&quot;</p>

  <p>Of the Frankelein Chaucer says, he was</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;An housholder, and that a gret was
      he;&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>the context plainly showing the meaning to be, &quot;hospitable on
  a great scale.&quot; Mr Horne ignorantly translates the words,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;A householder of great extent was
      he.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Chaucer we have&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      alway</span> <span class="i2">Stood ready covered all the longÃ¨
      day.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The meaning of that is, that any person, or party, might sit down,
  at any hour of the day, and help himself to something comfortable, as
  indeed is the case now in all country houses worth
  Visiting&#8212;such as Buchanan Lodge. Mr Horne stupidly exaggerates
  thus&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  feeble modernizer must he be who keeps adding to the number till he
  gives his readers the ear-ache. Not one of the following is in the

  <p>Mr Horne, in his Introduction, unconscious of his own sins, speaks
  with due contempt of the modernizations of Chaucer by Ogle and
  Lipscomb and their coadjutors, and of the injury they may have done
  to the reputation of the old poet. But whatever injury they may have
  occasioned, &quot;there can be doubt,&quot; he says, &quot;of the
  mischief done by Mr Pope&#39;s obscene specimen, <i>placed at the
  head</i> of his list of &#39;Imitations of English Poets.&#39; It is
  an imitation of those passages which we should only regard as the
  rank offal of a great feast in the olden time. The better taste and
  feeling of Pope should have imitated the noble <i>poetry</i> of
  Chaucer. He avoided this &#39;for sundry weighty reasons.&#39; But if
  this so-called imitation by Pope was &#39;done in his youth&#39; he
  should have burnt it in his age. Its publication at the present day
  among his elegant works, is a disgrace to modern times, and to his
  high reputation.&quot; Not so fast and strong, good Mister Horne. The
  six-and-twenty octosyllabic lines thus magisterially denounced by our
  stern moralist in the middle of the nineteenth century, have had a
  place in Pope&#39;s works for a hundred years, and it is too late now
  to seek to delete them. They were written by Pope in his fourteenth
  or fifteenth year, and gross <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120"
  id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> as they are, are pardonable in a
  boy of precocious genius, giving way for a laughing hour to his sense
  of the grotesque. Joe Warton (not Tom) pompously calls them &quot;a
  gross and <i>dull</i> caricature of the Father of English
  Poetry.&quot; And Mr Bowles says, &quot;he might have added, it is
  disgusting as it is dull, and no more like Chaucer than a
  <i>Billingsgate</i> is like an Oberea.&quot; It is <i>not</i> dull,
  but exceedingly clever; and Father Geoffrey himself would have
  laughed at it&#8212;patted Pope on the head&#8212;and enjoined him
  for the future to be more discreet. Roscoe, like a wise man, regards
  it without horror&#8212;remarking of it, and the boyish imitation of
  Spenser, that &quot;why these sportive and characteristic sketches
  should be brought to so severe an ordeal, and pointed out to the
  reprehension of the reader as gross and disagreeable, dull and
  disgusting, it is not easy to perceive.&quot; Old Joe maunders when
  he says, &quot;he that was unacquainted with Spenser, and was to form
  his ideas of the turn and manner of his genius from this piece, would
  undoubtedly suppose that he abounded in filthy images, and excelled
  in describing the lower scenes of life.&quot; Let all such blockheads
  suppose what they choose. Pope&#8212;says Roscoe&#8212;&quot;was well
  aware as any one of the superlative beauties and merits of Spenser,
  whose works he assiduously studied, both in his early and riper
  years; but it was not his intention in these few lines to give a
  <i>serious</i> imitation of him. All that he attempted was to show
  how exactly he could apply the language and manner of Spenser to low
  and burlesque subjects; and in this he has completely succeeded. To
  compare these lines, as Dr Warton has done, with those more extensive
  and highly-finished productions, the <i>Castle of Indolence</i> by
  Thomson, and the <i>Minstrel</i> by Beattie, is manifestly
  unjust&quot;&#8212;and stupidly absurd. What Mr Horne means by saying
  that Pope &quot;avoided imitating the noble poetry of Chaucer for
  sundry weighty reasons,&quot; is not apparent at first sight. It
  means, however, that Pope <i>could</i> not have done so&#8212;that
  the feat was beyond his power. The author of the <i>Messiah</i> and
  the <i>EloÃ¯se</i> wrote tolerable poetry of his own; and he knew how
  to appreciate, and to emulate, too, some of the finest of
  Chaucer&#39;s. Why did Mr Horne not mention his <i>Temple of
  Fame</i>? A more childish sentence never was written than &quot;its
  publication at the present day among his elegant works is a disgrace
  to modern times, and to his high reputation.&quot; Pope&#39;s
  reputation is above reproach, enshrined in honour for evermore, and
  modern times are not so Miss Mollyish as to sympathize with such
  sensitive censorship of an ingeniously versified peccadillo, at which
  our <i>avi</i> and <i>proavi</i> could not choose but smile.</p>

  <p>But Mr Horne, thinking, that in this case &quot;the child is
  father of the man,&quot; rates Pope as roundly for what he seems to
  suppose were the misdemeanours of his manhood. &quot;Of the
  highly-finished paraphrase, by Mr Pope, of the &#39;Wife of
  Bath&#39;s Prologue,&#39; and &#39;The Merchant&#39;s Tale,&#39;
  suffice it to say, that the licentious humour of the original being
  divested of its <i>quaintness and obscurity</i> (!) becomes yet more
  licentious in proportion to the fine touches of skill with which it
  is brought into the light. Spontaneous coarseness is made revolting
  by meretricious artifice. Instead of keeping in the distance that
  which was objectionable, by such shades in the modernizing as should
  have answered to the <i>hazy appearance</i> (!) of the original, it
  receives a clear outline, and is brought close to us. An ancient
  Briton, with his long rough hair and painted body, laughing and
  singing half-naked under a tree, may be coarse, yet innocent of all
  intention to offend; but if the imagination (absorbing the
  anachronism) can conceive him shorn of this falling hair, his paint
  washed off, and in this uncovered stated introduced into a
  drawing-room full of ladies in rouge and diamonds, hoops <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> and
  hair-powder, no one can doubt the injury thus done to the ancient
  Briton. This is no unfair illustration of what was done in the time
  of Pope,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>It may be &quot;no unfair illustration,&quot; and certainly is no
  unludicrous one. We must all of us allow, that were an ancient
  Briton, habited, or rather unhabited, as above, to bounce into a
  modern drawing-room full of ladies, whether in rouge and diamonds,
  hoops and hair-powder, or not, the effect of such <i>entrÃ©e</i> would
  be prodigious on the fair and fluttered Volscians. Our imagination,
  &quot;absorbing the anachronism,&quot; ensconces us professionally
  behind a sofa, to witness and to record the scene. How different in
  nature Christopher North and R.H. Horne! While he would be
  commiserating &quot;the injury thus done to the ancient Briton,&quot;
  we should be imploring our savage ancestor to spare the ladies.
  &quot;Innocent of all intention to offend&quot; might be Caractacus,
  but to the terrified bevy he would seem the king of the Cannibal
  Islands at least. What protection against the assault of a savage,
  almost <i>in puris naturalibus</i>, could be hoped for in their
  hoops! Yet who knows but that, on looking round and about, he might
  himself be frightened out of his senses? An ancient Briton, with his
  long rough hair and painted body, may laugh and sing by himself,
  half-naked under a tree, and in his own conceit be a match for any
  amount of women. But shorn of his falling hair, and without a streak
  of paint on his cheeks, verily his heart might be found to die within
  him, before furies with faces fiery with rouge, and heads horrent
  with pomatum&#8212;till instinctively he strove to roll himself up in
  the Persian carpet, and there prayed for deliverance to his tutelary
  gods.</p>

  <p>Our imagination having thus &quot;absorbed the anachronism,&quot;
  let us now leave Caractacus in the carpet&#8212;while our reason has
  recourse to the philosophy of criticism. Mr Horne asserts, that in
  &quot;Mr Pope&#39;s&quot; highly-finished paraphrase of the
  &quot;Wife of Bath&#39;s Prologue,&quot; and the &quot;Merchant&#39;s
  Tale,&quot; &quot;the licentious humour of the original is divested
  of its quaintness and obscurity, and becomes yet more licentious in
  proportion to the fine touches of skill with which it is brought into
  the light.&quot; Quaintness and <i>obscurity</i>!! Why, everything in
  those tales is as plain as a pike-staff, and clearer than mud.
  &quot;The hazy appearance of the original&quot; indeed! What! of the
  couple in the Pear-Tree? Mr Horne spitefully and perversely
  misrepresents the character of Pope&#39;s translations. They are
  remarkably free from the vice he charges them withal&#8212;and have
  been admitted to be so by the most captious critics. Many of the very
  strong things in Chaucer, which you may call coarse and gross if you
  will, are omitted by Pope, and many softened down; nor is there a
  single line in which the spirit is not the spirit of satire. The
  folly of senile dotage is throughout exposed as unsparingly, though
  with a difference in the imitation, as in the original. Even Joseph
  Warton and Bowles, affectedly fastidious over-much as both too often
  are, and culpably prompt to find fault, acknowledge that Pope&#39;s
  versions are blameless. &quot;In the art of telling a story,&quot;
  says Bowles, &quot;Pope is peculiarly happy; we almost forget the
  grossness of the subject of this tale, (the Merchant&#39;s,) while we
  are struck by the uncommon ease and readiness of the verse, the
  suitableness of the expression, and the spirit and happiness of the
  whole.&quot; While Dr Warton, sensibly remarking, &quot;that the
  character of a fond old dotard, betrayed into disgrace by an
  unsuitable match, is supported in a lively manner,&quot; refrains
  from making himself ridiculous by mealy-mouthed moralities which on
  such a subject every person of sense and honesty must despise. Mr
  Horne keeps foolishly carping at Pope, or &quot;Mr Pope,&quot; as he
  sometimes calls him, throughout his interminable&#8212;no, not
  interminable&#8212;his hundred-paged Introduction. He abominates
  Pope&#39;s Homer, and groans to think how it has corrupted the
  English ear by its long domination in our schools. He takes up, with
  leathern lungs, the howl of the Lakers, and his imitative bray is
  louder than the original, &quot;in linked sweetness long drawn
  out.&quot; Such sonorous strictures are innocent; but his false
  charge of licentiousness against Pope is most reprehensible&#8212;and
  it is insincere. For he has the sense to see Chaucer&#39;s broadest
  satire in its true light, and its fearless expositions. Yet from his
  justification of pictures and all their colouring in the ancient
  poet, that might well startle people by no means timid, he turns with
  frowning forehead and reproving hand to corresponding delineations in
  the modern, that stand less in need of it, and spits his spite on
  Pope, which we wipe off that it may not corrode. &quot;This
  translation was done at sixteen <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> or seventeen,&quot; says
  Pope in a note to his January and May&#8212;and there is not, among
  the achievements of early genius, to be found another such specimen
  of finished art and of perfect mastery.</p>

  <p>Mr. Horne has ventured to give in his volume the Reve&#39;s Tale.
  &quot;It has been thought,&quot; he says, &quot;that an idea of the
  extraordinary versatility of Chaucer&#39;s genius could not be
  adequately conveyed, unless one of his matter-of-fact comic tales
  were attempted. The Reve&#39;s has accordingly been selected, as
  presenting a graphic painting of character, equal to those contained
  in the &#39;Prologue to the Canterbury Tales,&#39; displayed in
  action by means of a story, which may be designated <i>as a broad
  farce, ending in a pantomime of absurd reality</i>. To those who are
  acquainted with the original, an apology may not be considered
  inadmissible for certain necessary variations and omissions.&quot;
  For our part, we do not object to this tale, though at the
  commencement of such a work its insertion was ill-judged, and will
  endanger greatly the volume. But we do object to the hypocritical
  cant about the licentiousness of Pope&#39;s fine touches, from the
  person who wrote the above words in italics. Omissions there must
  have been&#8212;but they sadly shear the tale of its vigour, and
  indeed leave it not very intelligible to readers who know not the
  original. The variations are most unhappy&#8212;miserable indeed; and
  by putting the miller&#39;s daughter to lie in a closet at the end of
  a passage, this moral modernizer has killed Chaucer. In the matchless
  original all the night&#39;s action goes on in one room&#8212;and
  that not a large one&#8212;miller, miller&#39;s wife, miller&#39;s
  daughter, and the two strenuous Cantabs, are within the same four
  narrow walls&#8212;their beds nearly touch&#8212;the jeopardized
  cradle has just space to rock in&#8212;yet this self-elected
  expositor of Chaucer is either so blind as not to see how essential
  such allocation of the parties is to the wicked comedy, or such a
  blunderer as to believe that he can improve on the greatest master
  that ever dared, and with perfect success, to picture, without our
  condemnation&#8212;so wide is the privilege of genius in sportive
  fancy&#8212;what, but for the self-rectifying spirit of fiction,
  would have been an outrage on nature, and in the number not only of
  forbidden but unhallowed things. The passages interpolated by Mr
  Horne&#39;s own pen are as bad as possible&#8212;clownish and
  anti-Chaucerian to the last degree.</p>

  <p>For example, he thus takes upon himself, in the teeth of Chaucer,
  to narrate Alein&#39;s night adventure&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;And up he rose, and crept along the
      floor,</span> <span class="i2">Into the passage humming with
      their snore;</span> <span class="i2">As narrow was it as a drum
      or tub,</span> <span class="i2">And like a beetle doth he grope
      and <i>grub</i>,</span> <span class="i2">Feeling his way, <i>with
      darkness in his hands</i>.</span> <span class="i2">Till at the
      passage end he stooping stands.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer tells us, without circumlocution, why the Miller&#39;s
  Wife for while had left her husband&#39;s side; but Mr Horne is
  intolerant of the indelicate, and thus elegantly paraphrases the one
  original word&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">"The wife her routing ceased soon after that:</span>
	  <span class="i2">And woke and left her bed; <i>for she was pained</i></span>
	  <span class="i2"><i>With nightmare dreams of skies that madly rained.</i></span>
	  <span class="i2"><i>Eastern astrologers and clerks, I wis,</i></span>
	  <span class="i2"><i>In time of Apis tell of storms like this.</i>&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Such is modern refinement!</p>

  <p>In Chaucer, the blind encounter between the Miller and one of the
  Cantabs, who, mistaking him for his comrade, had whispered into his
  ear what had happened during the night to his daughter, is thus
  comically described&#8212;</p>

      breast,</span> <span class="i2">And on the floor they tumble heel
      and crown,</span> <span class="i2">And shake the house, it
      seem&#39;d all coming down.</span> <span class="i2">And up they
      rise, and down again they roll:</span> <span class="i2">Till that
      the Miller, stumbling o&#39;er a coal,</span> <span class=
      "i2">Went plunging headlong like a bull at bait,</span>
      <span class="i2">And met his wife, and both fell flat as
      slate.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr Horne cannot read Chaucer. The Miller does not, as he makes him
  do, accuse the Cantab of falsely slandering his daughter&#39;s
  virtue. He does not doubt the truth of the unluckily blabbed secret;
  false harlot, false traitor, false clerk, are all words that tell his
  belief; but Mr Horne, not understanding &quot;disparage,&quot; as it
  is here used by Chaucer, wholly mistakes the cause of the
  father&#39;s fury. He does not even know, that it is the Miller who
  gets the bloody nose, not the Cantab. &quot;As don two piggÃ¨s in a
  poke,&quot; he leaves out, preferring, as more picturesque, &quot;And
  on the floor they tumble <i>heel and crown</i>!&quot; &quot;And shake
  the house&#8212;it seemed all coming down,&quot; is not in Chaucer,
  nor could be; but the crowning stupidity is that of making the Miller
  meet his wife, and upset her&#8212;she being all the while in bed,
  and now startled out of sleep by the weight of her fallen
  superincumbent husband. And this is modernizing Chaucer!</p>

  <p>What, then&#8212;after all we have written about him&#8212;we ask,
  can, at this day, be done with Chaucer? The true answer
  is&#8212;<span class='smcap'>read him</span>. The late Laureate dared
  to think that every one might; and in his collection, or selection,
  of English poets, down to Habington inclusive, he has given the
  prologue, and half a dozen of the finest and most finished tales;
  believing that every earnest lover of English poetry would by degrees
  acquire courage and strength to devour and digest a moderately-spread
  banquet. Without doubt, Southey did well. It was a challenge to
  poetical Young England to gird up his loins and fall to his work. If
  you will have the fruit, said the Laureate, you must climb the tree.
  He bowed some heavily-laden branches down to your eye, to tempt you;
  but climb you must, if you will eat. He displayed a generous trust in
  the growing desire and capacity of the country for her own
  time-shrouded poetical treasures. In the same full volume, he gave
  the &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; from the first word to the last.</p>

  <p>Let us hope boldly, as Southey hoped. But there are, in the
  present world, a host of excellent, sensitive readers, whose natural
  taste is perfectly susceptible of Chaucer, if he spoke their
  language; yet who have not the courage, or the leisure, or the
  aptitude, to master his. They must not be too hastily blamed if they
  do not readily reconcile themselves to a garb of thought which
  disturbs and distracts all their habitual associations. Consider, the
  &#39;ingenious feeling,&#39; the vital sensibility, with which they
  apprehend their own English, may place the insurmountable barrier
  which opposes their access to the father of our poetry. What can be
  done for them?</p>

  <p>In the first place, what is it that so much removes the language
  from us? It is removed by the words and grammatical forms that we
  have lost&#8212;by its real antiquity; perhaps more by an accidental
  semblance of antiquity&#8212;the orthography. That last may seem a
  small matter; but it is not.</p>

  <p>There are three ways in which literary craftsmen have attempted to
  fill up, or bridge over, the gulf of time, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> and
  bring the poet of Edward III. and Richard II. near to modern
  readers.</p>

  <p>Dryden and Pope are the representatives, as they are the masters,
  of the first method; for the others who have trodden in their
  footsteps are hardly to be named or thought of. Dryden and Pope hold,
  in their own school of modernizing, this undoubted distinction, that
  under their treatment, that which was poetry remains poetry. Their
  followers have written, for the most part, intelligible English, but
  never poetry. They have told the story, and not that always; but they
  have distilled lethargy on the tongue of the narrator.&#8212;This
  first method the most boldly departs from the type. It was probably
  the only way that the culture of Dryden&#39;s and Pope&#39;s time
  admitted of. We have since gradually returned, more and more, upon
  our own antiquity, as all the nations of Europe have upon theirs.
  Then civilization seemed to herself to escape forwards out of
  barbarism. Now she finds herself safe; and she ventures to seek light
  for her mature years in the recollections of her own childhood.</p>

  <p>But now, the altered spirit of the age has produced a new manner
  of modernization. The problem has been put thus. To retain of Chaucer
  whatever in him is our language, or is most nearly our
  language&#8212;only making good, always, the measure; and for
  expression, which time has left out of our speech, to substitute such
  as is in use. And several followers of the muses, as we have seen,
  have lately tried their hand at this kind of conversion.</p>

  <p>It is hard to judge both the system and the specimens. For if the
  specimens be thought to have succeeded, the system may, upon them, be
  favourably judged; but if the specimens have failed, the system must
  not upon them be unfavourably judged, but must in candour be looked
  upon as possibly carrying in itself means and powers that have not
  yet been unfolded. But unhappily a difficulty occurs which would not
  have occurred with a writer in prose&#8212;the law of the verse is
  imperious. Ten syllables must be kept, and rhyme must be kept; and in
  the experiment it results, generally, that whilst the rehabiting of
  Chaucer is undertaken under a necessity which lies wholly in the
  obscurity of his dialect&#8212;the proposed ground or motive of
  modernization&#8212;far the greater part of the actual changes are
  made for the sake of that which beforehand you might not think of,
  namely, the Verse. This it is that puts the translators to the
  strangest shifts and fetches, and besets the version, in spite of
  their best skill, with anti-Chaucerisms as thick as blackberries.</p>

  <p>It might, at first sight, seem as if there could be no remorse
  about dispersing the atmosphere of antiquity; and you might be
  disposed to say&#8212;a thought is a thought, a feeling a feeling, a
  fancy a fancy. Utter the thought, the feeling, the fancy, with what
  words you will, provided that they are native to the matter, and the
  matter will hold its own worth. No. There is more in poetry than the
  definite, separable matter of a fancy, a feeling, a thought. There is
  the indefinite, inseparable spirit, out of which they all arise,
  which verifies them all, harmonizes them all, interprets them all.
  There is the spirit of the poet himself. But the spirit of the time
  in which a poet lives, flows through the spirit of the poet.
  Therefore, a poet cannot be taken out of his own time, and rightly
  and wholly understood. It seems to follow that thought, feeling,
  fancy, which he has expressed, cannot be taken out of his own speech,
  and his own style, and rightly and wholly understood. Let us bring
  this home to Chaucer, and our occasion. The air of antiquity hangs
  about him, cleaves to him; therefore he is the venerable Chaucer. One
  word, beyond any other, expresses to us the difference betwixt his
  age and ours&#8212;Simplicity. To read him after his own spirit, we
  must be made simple. That temper is called up in us by the simplicity
  of his speech and style. Touched by these, and under their power, we
  lose our false habituations, and return to nature. But for this
  singular power exerted over us, this dominion of an irresistible
  sympathy, the hint of antiquity which lies in the language seems
  requisite. That summons us to put off our own, and put on another
  mind. In a half modernization, there lies the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> danger
  that we shall hang suspended between two minds&#8212;between two
  ages&#8212;taken out of one, and not effectually transported into
  that other. Might a poet, if it were worth while, who had imbued
  himself with antiquity and with Chaucer, depart more freely from him,
  and yet more effectually reproduce him? Imitating, not erasing, the
  colours of the old time&#8212;untying the strict chain that binds you
  to the fourteenth century, but impressing on you candour, clearness,
  shrewdness, ingenuous susceptibility, simplicity, <span class=
  'smcap'>Antiquity</span>! A creative translator or
  imitator&#8212;Chaucer born again, a century and a half later.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here is the master of the art; and his work, most of all,
  therefore, makes us doubt the practicability of the thing undertaken.
  He works reverently, lovingly, surely with full apprehension of
  Chaucer; and yet, at every word where he leaves Chaucer, the spirit
  of Chaucer leaves the verse. You see plainly that his rule is to
  change the least that can possibly be changed. Yet the gentle grace,
  the lingering musical sweetness, the taking simplicity, of the wise
  old poet, vanishes&#8212;brushed away like the down from the
  butterfly&#39;s wing, by the lightest and most timorous touch.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;For he can make of lowÃ¨ hertÃ¨s
      highe.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is the soul of the lover&#39;s poet, of the poet himself a
  lover, poured out and along in one fond verse, gratefully consecrated
  to the mystery of love, which he, too, has experienced when
  he&#8212;the shy, the fearful, the reserved&#8212;was yet by the
  touch of that all-powerful ray which</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;Shoots invisible virtue even to the
      deep,&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>enkindled, and to his own surprise made elate to hope and to
  dare.</p>

  <p>But now contract, as Wordsworth does, the dedicated verse into a
  half verse, and bring together the two distinct and opposite
  mysteries under one enunciation&#8212;in short, divide the one verse
  to two subjects&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;For he of low hearts can make
      high&#8212;of high</span> <span class="i2">He can make
      low;&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and the fact vouched remains the same, the simplicity of the words
  is kept, for they are the very words, and yet something is
  gone&#8212;and in that something every thing! There is no longer the
  dwelling upon the words, no longer the dilated utterance of a heart
  that melts with its own thoughts, no longer the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
  consecration of the verse to its matter, no longer the softness, the
  light, the fragrance, the charm&#8212;no longer, in a word, the old
  manner. Here is, in short, the philosophical observation touching
  love, &quot;the saw of might&quot; still; but the love itself here is
  not. A kindly and moved observer speaks, not a lover.</p>

  <p>In one of the above-cited stanzas, Urry seems to have misled
  Wordsworth. Stanza iv. verse 4, Chaucer says:&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;And whoso that he wol, he lougheth or
      siketh.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The sense undoubtedly is, &quot;and whosoever <span class=
  'smcap'>he</span>&quot;&#8212;namely, the God of
  Love&#8212;&quot;will, <span class=
  'smcap'>he</span>&quot;&#8212;namely, the Lover&#8212;&quot;laugheth
  or sigheth accordingly.&quot; But Urry mistaking the
  construction&#8212;supposed that <span class='smcap'>he</span>, in
  both places, meant the god only. He had, therefore, to find out in
  &quot;lougheth&quot; and &quot;siketh,&quot; actions predicable of
  the love-god. The verse accordingly runs thus with him,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;And who that he wol, he loweth or
      siketh.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now, it is true, that, after all, we do not exactly know how Urry
  understood his own reading; for he did not make his own glossary. But
  from his glossary, we find that &quot;to lowe&quot; is to praise, to
  allow, to approve&#8212;furthermore that &quot;siketh&quot; in this
  place means &quot;maketh sick.&quot; Wordsworth, following as it
  would appear the lection of Urry, but only half agreeing to the
  interpretation of Urry&#39;s glossarist, has rendered the line</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;To humble or afflict whome&#39;er he
      will.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He has understood in his own way, from an obvious suggestion,
  &quot;loweth,&quot; to mean, maketh low, humbleth; whilst
  &quot;afflict&quot; is a ready turn for &quot;maketh sick&quot; of
  the glossary. But here Wordsworth cannot be in the right. For Chaucer
  is now busied with magnifying the kingdom of love by accumulated
  antitheses&#8212;high, low&#8212;sick, whole&#8212;wise,
  foolish&#8212;the wicked turns good, the proud shrink and
  fear&#8212;the God, at his pleasure, gladdens or grieves. The phrase
  under question must conform to the manner of the place where it
  appears. An opposition of meanings is indispensable. &quot;Humble or
  afflict,&quot; which are both on one side, cannot be right.
  &quot;Approveth or maketh sick,&quot; are on opposite sides, but will
  hardly pick one another out for antagonists. &quot;Laugheth or
  sigheth,&quot; has the vividness and simplicity of Chaucer, the most
  exact contrariety matches them&#8212;and the two phenomena cannot be
  left out of a lover&#39;s enumeration.</p>

  <p>Chaucer says of his &#39;bosom&#39;s lord,&#39;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;And most his might he sheddeth ever in
      May&quot;&#8212;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>renowning here, as we saw that he does elsewhere, the whole month,
  as love&#39;s own segment of the zodiacal circle. The time of the
  poem itself is accordingly &#39;the thridde night of May.&#39;
  Wordsworth has rendered,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;But most his might he sheds <i>on the eve
      of May.</i>&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Why so? Is the approaching visitation of the power more strongly
  felt than the power itself in presence? Chaucer says distinctly the
  contrary, and why with a word lose, or obscure, or hazard the
  appropriation of the month entire, so conspicuous a tenet in the old
  poetical mind? And is Eve here taken strictly&#8212;the night before
  May-day, like the <i>Pervigilium Veneris</i>? Or loosely, on the
  verge of May, answerably to &#39;ayenes May&#39; afterwards? To the
  former sense, we might be inclined to propose on the contrary
  part,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;But sheds his might most on the morrow of
      May,&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>i.e.</i> in prose on May-day morning, consonantly to all the
  testimonies.</p>

  <p>Chaucer says that the coming-on of the love-month produces in the
  heart of the lover</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">&quot;A maner easÃ¨ medled with
      grevaunce.&quot;</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That is to say, <i>a kind of</i> joy or pleasure, (Fr.
  <i>aise</i>,) mixed with sadness. He insists, by this expression,
  upon the strangeness of the kind, peculiar to the willing sufferers
  under this unique passion, &quot;love&#39;s pleasing smart.&quot; Did
  Wordsworth, by intention or misapprehension, leave out this turn of
  expression, by which, in an age less forward than ours in sentimental
  researches, Chaucer drew notice to the contradictory nature of the
  internal state which he described? <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> As if Chaucer had said,
  &quot;<i>al</i> maner esÃ¨,&quot; Wordsworth says, &quot;all kinds of
  pleasure mixed with sorrowing.&quot;</p>

  <p>In the next line he adds to the intuitions of his master, one of
  his own profound intuitions, if we construe aright&#8212;</p>

  <p>That ever long! The sweetest of thoughts are never satisfied with
  their own deliciousness. Earthly delight, or heavenly delight upon
  earth, penetrating the soul, stirs in it the perception of its native
  illimitable capacity for delight. Bliss, which should wholly possess
  the blest being, plays traitor to itself, turns into a sort of divine
  dissatisfaction, and brings forth from its teeming and infinite bosom
  a brood of winged wishes, bright with hues which memory has bestowed,
  and restless with innate aspirations. Such is our commentary on the
  truly Wordsworthian line, but it is not a line answerable to
  Chaucer&#39;s&#8212;</p>

  <p>Is this hypercriticism? It is the only criticism that can be
  tolerated betwixt two such rivals as Chaucer and Wordsworth. The
  scales that weigh poetry should turn with a grain of dust, with the
  weight of a sunbeam, for they weigh spirit. Or is it saying that
  Wordsworth has not done his work as well as it was possible to be
  done? Rather it is inferring, from the failure of the work in his
  hand, that he and his colleagues have attempted that which was
  impossible to be done. We will not here hunt down line by line. We
  put before the reader the means of comparing verse with verse. We
  have, with &#39;a thoughtful heart of love,&#39; made the comparison,
  and feel throughout that the modern will not, cannot, do justice to
  the old English. The quick sensibility which thrills through the
  antique strain deserts the most cautious version of it. In short, we
  fall back upon the old conviction, that verse is a sacred, and song
  an inspired thing; that the feeling, the thought, the word, and the
  musical breath spring together out of the soul in one creation; that
  a translation is a thing not given in <i>rerum natura</i>;
  consequently that there is nothing else to be done with a great poet
  saving to leave him in his glory.</p>

  <p>And our friend John Dryden? Oh, he is safe enough; for the new
  translators all agree that his are no translations at all of Chaucer,
  but original and excellent poems of his own.</p>

  <p>A language that is half Chaucer&#39;s, and half that of his
  renderer, is in great danger to be the language of nobody. But
  Chaucer&#39;s has its own energy and vivacity which attaches you, and
  as soon as you have undergone the due transformation by sympathy,
  carries you effectually with it. In the moderate versions that are
  best done, you miss this indispensable force of attraction. But
  Dryden boldly and freely gives you himself, and along you sweep, or
  are swept rejoicingly along. &quot;The grand charge to which his
  translations are amenable,&quot; says Mr Horne, &quot;is, that he
  acted upon an erroneous principle.&quot; Be it so. Nevertheless, they
  are among the glories of our poetical literature. Mr Horne&#39;s,
  literal as he supposes them to be, are unreadable. He, too, acts on
  an erroneous principle; and his execution betrays throughout the
  unskilful hand of a presumptuous apprentice. But he has &quot;every
  respect for the genius, and for every thing that belongs to the
  memory, of Dryden;&quot; and thus magniloquently eulogizes his most
  splendid achievement:&#8212;&quot;The fact is, Dryden&#39;s version
  of the &#39;Knight&#39;s Tale&#39; would be most appropriately read
  by the towering shade of one of Virgil&#39;s heroes, walking up and
  down a battlement, and waving a long, gleaming spear, to the roll and
  sweep of his sonorous numbers.&quot;</p>
